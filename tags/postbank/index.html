	<div class="main">
		<p>Today&#8217;s economy is all about money, it has been like that for years and it will probably be like that for the remainder of time, unless someone comes up with an ingenious solution that replaces money with another object of value that is easy to exchange, both in the real world as well as digitally. Since I don&#8217;t see that happening any time soon, I might as well discuss an idea I had about teaching our young ones how to &#8220;work&#8221; with money.</p>
<p>Before we start, let&#8217;s take a minute to think back. I think I got my first money to spend at the age of seven, but I had been spending other people&#8217;s money (namely from my parents) before that. I would be rewarded for school activity as well as the occasional monetary present for birthdays. While this worked out nicely for me back then, I think the system is flawed. Later on, when you&#8217;re a grown-up, nobody will give you money just because you turn a year older. Well, some people might do, but those are the ones with bad taste, and it&#8217;s never going to be enough to sustain yourself. Basically, I think that parents are teaching their children nothing about the value of money by &#8220;just&#8221; giving them access to funds.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m proposing, basically, is the following: give children money, based on the work they carry out. Chores should of course be appropriate to their age, you can&#8217;t expect a five year-old to go shopping, you might end up with no money at all and a bill for the dentist. Have kids work around the house. Most children aren&#8217;t interested in that kind of stuff at those ages, so why not utilize a system that works so well, even primates pick up on it?</p>
<p>The &#8220;do this, get that&#8221; method is, if you ask me, a lot better than just giving kids an allowance that you replenish whenever the kids need it. Working for money is an essential factor of life, so why not start out as early as possible? Protecting your children from the harshness that is the world? Well, good luck with that. What good does that do? Ten years later, you have children who are completely incapable of managing the funds they have access to and you&#8217;ll end up having to teach them the whole system after all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read about people who taught their children the value of money in creative ways. Mom would tell her son to look through grocery fliers and the more coupons and great deals he could get, the more they would save. The saved money then, would be his reward. Does that teach children the value of money? You bet it does. The more you save, the more you get to keep. It&#8217;s as easy as that.</p>
<p>Now, in todays digital world, you could enhance the whole process a lot. Create a game I say. One that is a win-win solution for everyone involved, parents, children and the economy. If you&#8217;re going to create it, however, you should do it the right way. A famous Dutch financial institution tried and in my eyes, fail to meet the goal I&#8217;m trying for.</p>
<p>Said bank came up with a system that let&#8217;s you save money. You have a piece of hardware, connected to your computer. Put in a dime and you&#8217;ll see the computer process it in a visual way. You can always see how much you have, but you can&#8217;t really use it. It works great to teach people about saving money, but, in the end, why do we save money? Exactly, to spend it, when the time comes.</p>
<p>Their system lets children play games that are branded with the companies logos and everything. Every game costs a certain amount of points. You have x points every day and a game costs, say 1/10 of x. So you can play ten games a day. Very nice, if you want to keep your kid from turning into a gambler, but it doesn&#8217;t teach them anything about the real value. Like before, the problem is that the points are restored daily. In fact, parents can even buy more points for you, if need be.</p>
<p>My idea is different. Let&#8217;s create a game that combines online and offline chores. It&#8217;s gotta be entertaining to the kids, or they won&#8217;t play it, but it&#8217;s also gotta be educative. I propose to utilize the &#8220;do this, get that&#8221; method.</p>
<p>The application itself, would be aimed at an audience between three and six, so it would be heavy on the visual side and only include easy to read (and understand) text for the player. The application is basically a shell, your access to a myriad of minigames, some of which could be branded by the companies that support this game (and I&#8217;m certain, there would be quite a few).</p>
<p>Each minigame has to be entertaining. You&#8217;d have simple games, for example, stuff where you match pairs but also more advanced stuff, for example, reading easy words and linking them to their visual counterparts. After completing a level, the &#8220;boss&#8221; of that level is a real-world chore, related to the game. If you matched pairs ingame, why not go help your mom match socks? Sounds easy, but it would help both parents and children. The idea is that the kids first play something, then complete a chore, related to the game and finally get their reward. Both points in game as well as a monetary reward.</p>
<p>The game contains sophisticated tracking systems so that you can see how long your kid takes for a certain part, but I&#8217;d advise to spend the time on the computer <em>with</em> your kid, after all, there&#8217;s no better guardian than the one that&#8217;s there, when they need it. The tracking system also will show you statistics, like what does your child like to do most? What does it <em>not</em> like? You can then adjust the rewards in a way that for example, cleaning up the room, something just about every child hates, becomes a lot more interesting, financially speaking.</p>
<p>Heck, we could even digitize the aforementioned idea about having your kid look through grocery folders. Said minigame would have to be sponsored by a grocery store of course and the coupons would be for their products only. The player would be presented with a selection of say hundred coupons and then mark the ones that are of interest to him or her. Once the &#8220;level&#8221; is finished, call your parents, have them check the list, print it out and if they approve, enter a special parent-code™ that would translate into the reward.</p>
<p>Said parent-codes™ are printed lists with an unique identifier. There&#8217;s a pair of two codes each. One you have to enter before you start a game, one you have to enter after the player has completed a level. The game doesn&#8217;t handle situations where you start a game, then start another though because players are expected to only commit to something if they are willing to pull through. Much like in real life, later on.</p>
<p>All in all, this game has the potential to do three things: help children understand the value of money, help parents with their workload and help the economy create people who understand the value of money and brand children with brands they will be buying later on.</p>
