	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on December 4th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Three days ago, I attended BRIGHTLive with some friends of mine and considering the price we paid, we certainly got our money&#8217;s worth. The whole venue was a lot more commercial than I&#8217;d have liked it to be, but that&#8217;s to be expected really. It&#8217;s the same for CeBIT and other, similar events.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll cut the guys from BRIGHT some slack though, since this was the first incarnation and I&#8217;m quite certain that the next BRIGHTLives will be a lot bigger.</p>
<p>When I first read <a href="http://www.bright.nl/">BRIGHT</a>, at the Web 2.0 conference &#8220;<a href="http://www.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web</a>&#8220;, I was immediately sold. The content of this mag links up nicely with my topics of interest and it&#8217;s generally stuff that isn&#8217;t available 6 weeks up front via the internet (to be honest, it probably is, but I&#8217;m too lazy to spend time on looking for it).</p>
<p>So, back then, I signed up for a trial of three issues and read thru the day I received each one; I wanted to prolong my subscription, but decided to wait a little bit, till after BRIGHTLive, to see if they&#8217;d come up with a really good reason.</p>
<p>Turns out I don&#8217;t have to wait that long: I managed to talk Dion, a BRIGHTLive staffer, into handing me over one of the official BRIGHTLive tee&#8217;s for nada. In return, I signed up for another three issues of their mag. Quite the win-win situation for both of us, especially considering that the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/brightlive_06/brightlive_kay/IMG_1896.JPG.html">official price</a> for those tees was EUR 25. Thanks Dion!</p>
<p>All in all, BRIGHTLive was certainly worth the time, especially if you consider that we got to see an improv-performance from <a href="http://www.boomchicago.nl/">BOOM Chicago</a> new show &#8220;Me, MySpace and iPod&#8221;. I even managed to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhxdPzCmaVc">record one of their songs</a>, albeit the visual result turned out quite bad. Turns out that BOOM Chicago isn&#8217;t for everyone. While I loved their show and couldn&#8217;t stop laughing, the other guys attending the show didn&#8217;t appreciate it as much.</p>
<p>Naturally, I&#8217;ve uploaded a &#8220;few&#8221; shots from BRIGHTLive to my <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/brightlive_06/">gallery</a> too. Enjoy.</p>

		<p>Today was awesome. We had loads of fun with alł the gadgets and toys here. this expo showcased some really hot stuff, most of it way too expensive, yet still insanely cool.</p>
<p>After some three hours we decided that it was time for a short break. We found a cosy Chinese take-away and enjoyed some of the most delicious wok food I&#8217;ve aten in a long time.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m back at BRIGHTlive to finish off the evening with, what I expect to be an amazing performance from the guys (and gals) from <a href="http://www.boomchicago.nl/">BOOM Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>As always, I took loads of pictures and I&#8217;ll upload them later on.</p>

		<p>Okay, time for some blogging now.</p>
<p>So far, BRIGHTlive rocks. We were one of the first to enter the building. The whole event is located in the beautiful Westergasfabriek, kind of like old meets ultra-new.</p>
<p>BRIGHTlive is supposed to be a fresh, fun and frigging great experience and if you´re not here you´re missing out big time, seriously.</p>
<p>More blogging later, I gotta take care of my inner geek now.</p>

		<h2 id="post-34"><a href="../../../../../2006/11/29/next-night-10/index.html" rel="bookmark">Next Night 1.0</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on November 29th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>So I didn&#8217;t find any time to blog about the Next Night last night, mostly because I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable pulling out my laptop while everyone was listening but let me tell you that it itched in my fingers &#8230; so without furder ado, I&#8217;ll write up a short re-cap of yesterday&#8217;s events:</p>
<p>FYI: Next Night 1.0 was about Gamevertising and Advergames, putting ads into games and creating games to increase brand awareness and get people to buy your products.</p>
<p>The evening started out with us (<a href="http://inmyvision.net/">Jack</a>, me) being a bit late, thanks to the horrible public transport service currently offered. We missed the first half of the first keynote but managed to catch the second half. It was interesting, but didn&#8217;t rock.</p>
<p>Then came a duo of speakers who really knew how to cater to this audience - <a href="http://www.mediamonks.nl/">MediaMonks</a>. Those guys were cocky, in a great way. They showcase&#8217;d some of their projects and the way they approached projects. Most of the people I talked to agreed that their presentation was without a doubt the best one. Not just because of their interesting presentation style, involving two very different people (one a media strategist, the other a creative technologist) who didn&#8217;t see eye to eye on some issues and mocked each other in a respectful way, but also because of the time they took to answer our questions in a very honest way.</p>
<p>I took some time to read up on them before I went to the event and from what I gather, their company must be one of the best you could work for, if you&#8217;re looking for a great team of highly creative, highly energetic minds.</p>
<p>The last speaker was a guy from the University of Amsterdam, a true researcher who discussed how bad it would be to put advertising into games like World of Warcraft. You could tell by the way he was talking that he was a true addict, trying to protect &#8220;his precious&#8221;. I disliked the fact that he couldn&#8217;t really stay objective. Like, he &#8220;sanctioned&#8221; advertising for games like FIFA &#8216;07, because of the added realism, but bashed advertising in games like Battlefield 2142.</p>
<p>He, on the other hand, liked the sort of viral marketing Microsoft used for marketing Halo 2 (ILoveBees) and appreciated that Rockstar Entertainment created loads of spoofs for their GTA series of games. I&#8217;m just baffled as to why he decided not to talk about Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. A modern-day game using modern day advertisement for products like Wrigley&#8217;s chewing gum, Axe body spray, powered by Massive Inc.&#8217; in-game advertising technique. Other than that, he also forgot to mention older games like Tony Hawk&#8217;s Pro Skater 2, 3 and similar games which actually live on in-game advertising to add a new layer of realism to the game.</p>
<p>Summarizing, the first Next Night, if you ask me, was a total success. It&#8217;s not yet a high-octane event, but if they continue like this, they will be.<br />
The best thing about Generation Next? It&#8217;s a kind of fraternity and no one even knew.</p>
<p>When I started out in college, I decided not to join any fraternity, because I didn&#8217;t see the added value of it. I also didn&#8217;t want to go thru various introductory rites like drinking blood from a chicken or running around naked. Generation Next on the other hand is different, they don&#8217;t have that kind of crap, you don&#8217;t have to pay any fees and it&#8217;s not obligatory to get drunk every Wedneday through Friday. What you do get, however, is a great community of creative and very motivated people as well as valuable business contacts with the people you&#8217;ll be either working for or with in the years to come.</p>
<p>Congrats to the <a href="http://www.generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a> team for setting up an awesome event. If you guys are looking to start a &#8220;street team&#8221; in my college, I&#8217;ll gladly help out!</p>
