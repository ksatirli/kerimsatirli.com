	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on March 2nd, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>This past Tuesday, <a href="http://www.generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a> organized the second evening in their, so far, successful, series of events called &#8220;Next Night&#8221;. The idea behind these events is to bring (CMD) students in touch with market influencer as well as innovation leaders and academic researchers, thereby creating an intriguing evening loaded with useful information. The best thing is that it&#8217;s limited to a small group of people and so far, I&#8217;ve only seen people who <strong>really</strong> wanted to be there.</p>
<p>The evening was kicked off by Barend Raaff from <a href="http://www.dnbmedia.com/">DNB Media</a>. The speech contained some interesting questions - for example in regards of the latest events that are happening in Second Life and who should be held accountable for them:</p>
<p>Mr. Raaff likes to think of Second Life as a means of communication, not unlike the phone system operated by KPN or Ma Bell. He goes on to explain that the medium cannot be blamed for the things some, misguided users do with it.</p>
<p>This week, two nuclear missiles were <a href="http://www.dutchcowboys.nl/online/9572/">exploded</a> in Second Life. The objective behind this mission that was spearheaded by the Second Life Liberation Army (SLLA) is to make Linden Labs, the developers of the game, aware to the fact that users want to more control over the Sims (the gaming environments) and that they won&#8217;t refrain from taking game altering actions.</p>
<p>The type of bomb that was used can be acquired in-game and their effect is nearly as devastating as in real life. The explosions consume so much CPU power that the servers just shut down. With 2700 Second Life servers out there, one would think that two servers wouldn&#8217;t matter, but unfortunately they do. Every time, someone sets off a bomb and kills a server, there is a 25% chance that the server that crashes will take another server with it. This percentage increases by one point with every server that gets killed successfully.</p>
<p>The shutdown also means that any data that wasn&#8217;t saved might be lost, which could incur real-world economical ramifications, because, after all, the Second Life currency known as Linden Dollars has to be acquired by real world money. On that topic, Mr. Raaff also noted that he doesn&#8217;t (yet) consider Linden Dollars to be a threat to actual real-world currency.</p>
<p>The second speaker was Bas van Ulden, head of the Second Life team of <a href="http://www.abnamro.nl/">ABN AMRO</a>, a well known financial institution. His team managed to create an online presence inside Second Life, thereby earning his team the title of &#8220;First European bank in Second Life&#8221;. Quite a feat, especially if you consider that most of the team didn&#8217;t use Second Life before and they managed to build the whole thing in a mere eight weeks.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that ABN AMRO bought 32 sims, however, only six or seven are currently in use and by summer 2007, another ten sims will be made accessible to the general public. I&#8217;m curious as to what they have in store for their customers.</p>
<p>I think their approach, so far, is unique. They are the first European bank I know off that let&#8217;s you &#8220;skype&#8221; with your account manager (as opposed to calling an expensive phone number) as well as check your account balance via <a href="../../../../../tech-talk/guides/geeky-tools-you-will-want-to-use/index.html">MSN Messenger</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, the decision to start out in Second Life was entirely business based, after all, the Netherlands are home to the biggest non-English community on Second Life.  However, you can tell that this bank really values the social aspect of the Internet and Mr. Ulden&#8217;s speech was probably the best of the whole evening. Not because it offered possible employment opportunities to anyone interested and qualified, but rather because he was very open about the whole experience. He didn&#8217;t refrain from telling us how much they did wrong and how they had to learn the hard way.</p>
<p>I value his honesty and I think it tells a lot about how he and his small team of ten thinks of the net community.</p>
<p>The keynote was concluded by some statistics which gave some insight into the success of the whole operation. It turned out that ABN AMRO gets about 500 to 600 visitors a week in all their Sims combined and even though they only cater to the Dutch market right now, they get the occasional foreign visitor too.</p>
<p>After a short break, Raymond van der Kaaij from <a href="http://www.lostinthemagicforest.com/">(lost in the) Magic Forest</a> kicked off the second half of the evening by sharing some insight into the hows and whats of marketing in Second Life. For example, if you want to expand your base of operations into Second Life, you should ask yourself how you can do that in a way that links up with your offline brand. It is important to know how you can add value to the experience of the visitor and how you can turn them into recurring visitors.</p>
<p>Mr. van der Kaaij also believes the &#8220;whole thing&#8221; to be about experience design: &#8220;If there&#8217;s no experience then there&#8217;s no unique selling point and that&#8217;s when you should stop considering Second Life as a base of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>David de Nood from <a href="http://www.epn.net/">EPN</a> concluded the evening by explaining how Second Life was a game without a set ending point, but far from pointless. He also shared some very interesting stats with us. It turns out that from the group of heavy users, that is, people that play approximately ten to forty hours a week, more than half is female. What&#8217;s even more interesting is that this group is between 25 and 40 years old and has at least completed college. Most of them have creative jobs in the IT or marketing sector.</p>
<p>Even though this group plays an average of 25 hours a week, only 40% of the members consider themselves addicted to the game. The main reason, according to Mr. de Nood is, that the psycho-social wellbeing in-game, is a lot higher than outside, in the real world. It&#8217;s easier to establish contacts because there&#8217;s some sense of anonymity. EPN&#8217;s research also predicts that more businesses (especially those with goods related to Second Life) will open up to payments made in Linden Dollars.</p>
<p>The evening was concluded with an informal discussion where all of the speakers actively took part in. Thanks a lot to Marc and Noortje and the other members from <a href="http://www.generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a> for setting up this meeting. Congratulations on a job well done. I&#8217;m already looking forward to see what you guys can come up with for Next Night 3.0!</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a>, <a href="../../../../personal-stuff/index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on February 25th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>I just came back from spending some quality time with a good friend of mine and I somehow had the urge to blog about tonight. We went to see &#8220;<a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thepursuitofhappyness/">The Pursuit of Happyness</a>&#8220;, a reflection on the life of Christopher Gardner, the guy who didn&#8217;t just live the American dream, no, he rewrote it.</p>
<p>The movie tells the story of the struggle and difficulties Gardner, who is portrayed by Will Smith, has to overcome in order to succeed. I must admit, the beginning of the movie was rather &#8230; shall we say, uninteresting, it was strange to see Will Smith use bad language, &#8217;cause he barely ever does that and while I&#8217;m able to handle bad language, it didn&#8217;t seem fitting.</p>
<p>After half an hour though, the story had gotten to me. Smith is a great actor and he has portrayed some great characters, but this one, was, hands down, the best thing I&#8217;ve ever seen him do. Now, I&#8217;m no big shot movie critic but this movie has all it needs:</p>
<p>Smith and his (real life) son are portrayed in a great array of situations, you can see them having fun together and you can literally read Gardner&#8217;s mind, the thoughts that are crossing through it, the problems and challenges he is facing. It&#8217;s surreal.</p>
<p>The movie makes you feel bad, just looking at those pictures, the fight Smith has to put up to with in order to reach his final goal, to succeed in getting a job at Dean Witter Reynolds, a stock brokerage firm. The ordeals Gardner went through are &#8230; amazing.</p>
<p>Now, the movie portrays the whole internship thing as an unpaid training, while Gardner actually received $1,000 and there are some other things that aren&#8217;t told in the same way it happened back in 1981, but still, this movie touched me on a level that no movie ever did until now.</p>
<p>I may not have faced the hardships that Chris Gardner has faced and I may never face them, but his story and most of all, the way he solved the problems he was thrown at inspires me. Gardner doesn&#8217;t know the concept of &#8220;giving up&#8221; and for what it&#8217;s worth, he is a better man for that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to spend a few bucks on a great story, I can more than recommend checking out this movie. No matter if you watch it on a DVD, in a cinema or just grab the <a href="http://fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook38506.htm">book</a>, the story will get to you.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, this year might only be a couple of weeks old, but I have found my favorite movie of the year already.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p><a href="http://www.fokjou.nl/">Marc</a> just reminded me of a clip that the guys from <a href="http://www.molblog.nl/">molbog</a> shot during the awesome &#8220;<a href="http://www.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web</a>&#8221; Conference, which was held in Amsterdam last July.</p>
<p>In the video, the interviewer asks people what their definition of the next web is. The camera guy sadly didn&#8217;t have access to a silent recording environment, so you&#8217;ll probably have to watch this clip at least twice to be able to understand all the things people say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the clip too, discussing what I think the next web is and will be. Funnily enough, my visions of what the web links up very nicely with what <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/">Steven Pemberton</a> (of <a href="http://w3c.org/">W3C</a> fame) had to say.</p>
<p>So, without further ado - I give you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igvx00ms6MM">the clip</a> and before you ask, no, I have no clue as to what I was on that caused my excessive movement&#8230;</p>

		<h2 id="post-59"><a href="../../../../../2007/02/08/rss-killed-the-tv-news-channel/index.html" rel="bookmark">RSS killed the TV (news channel)</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on February 8th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>While reading my news feeds this week, I came across an interesting <a href="http://www.marketingfacts.nl/berichten/20070206_steeds_meer_hoogopgeleide_jongeren_zetten_tv_bij_grofvuil/#When:10:16:01Z">article</a> posted on the Dutch blog called <a href="http://www.marketingfacts.nl/">Marketing Facts</a>.</p>
<p>According to recently published research, more and more YUPs and above-average-educated teenagers switch their TV sets for news from sites such as YouTube, Google Video and regional, web-based, streaming content providers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t plan on copying the whole article, there&#8217;s one thing that grabbed my attention. Koen van Tongeren, visibile in <a href="http://www.marketingfacts.nl/images/uploads/20070206-nrc-mediagebruik-jongeren-small.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[59]">this picture</a> stopped watching (traditional) TV and switched to a Mac and watches digital TV on his wall by means of a beamer. Not the cheapest solution I guess, but certainly interesting.</p>
<p>If you look at the picture, you&#8217;ll see that van Tongeren is watching at least three shows at the same time, probably more in the background. Of course, TV sets that are able to display more than one channel at the same time have been available for some time, but I like van Tongeren&#8217;s setup a lot more. He&#8217;s grabbing the news <em>he</em> wants to read, perfect content personalization.</p>
<p>Marco Derksen, the author of the original post, also asks the question as to how long his readers plan to keep using TV sets in the living room. Thinking about it, I believe that we&#8217;ll have a TV set around for some time to come. Granted, I don&#8217;t use it to watch anything anymore, other than CNN, but it&#8217;s good to have a fallback in case something happens.</p>
<p>Other&#8217;s also appreciate it that we still use a TV; while I personally don&#8217;t mind watching a show on my Laptop, I know that it&#8217;s no fun at all to watch a good DVD on a 14&#8243; screen. However, this wasn&#8217;t really the question Derksen asked, after all, if you only use your TV to screen a DVD, it&#8217;s little more than a display device.</p>
<p>Derksen, albeit using the wrong words, is curious about how &#8220;<a href="http://www.marketingfacts.nl/berichten/20070206_steeds_meer_hoogopgeleide_jongeren_zetten_tv_bij_grofvuil/#reacties">we</a>&#8220;, the current generation, consumes news:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious that everyone has his or her own way of getting the latest news, but I think, most people are using RSS to keep up with it. I certainly do and I do it alot. In the past month, I&#8217;ve read close to 9,000 items - that&#8217;s 300 new items every day, on average.</p>
<p>Information overload? No, because most sites only provide you with a short teaser of the actual article, so you can decide on the spot if you want to keep reading or if you&#8217;d rather move on to the next item. From all the items, I probably end up reading 40% which is still a lot but this way, I can keep up with the game and keep myself informed. Naturally, sites like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN.com</a> also help out a lot with getting the latest news.</p>
<p>All in all, I see two changes here - the way we consume news has changed to a more personalized format and I don&#8217;t believe that TV broadcasting can continue like it is now without offering at least one third of the personalization options the web offers. People don&#8217;t care for news that have no value to them, so why alienate your consumer base?</p>
<p>Second, the amount of news has increased by at least ten times. While people still remain somewhat loyal to their favourite channel, thanks to the myriad of sources out there, viewers have a lot more choice and what is considered a criminal on one channel, could be a patriot on another. Every channel has their own way of &#8220;spicing up&#8221; the news, it&#8217;s up to the viewer to pick the one that &#8220;tastes&#8221; best.</p>

		<p>Whenever you read news from the entertainment industry, you hear C - level staff complaining about how bad digital music is hurting sales and how hard it is to sell music to people because everyone just pirates it, you&#8217;ve heard those for years now, you&#8217;ll keep hearing them for quite some time more.</p>
<p>Sure, there&#8217;s Apple and the iTMS, which is doing quite well - because there are lots of iPods out there and people are easily tricked into buying more than one song ( &#8220;come on mom, it&#8217;s only a buck!&#8221; ). The whole store is doing well, in fact, a lot better than the top 10 stores that sell DRM-secured Windows Media Audio files together, but there are still those that dislike how Apple handles DRM.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t feel like getting into the whole DRM discussion more than I have to, mostly because I&#8217;m no expert on it, but from personal experience I know that certain DRM schemes are hurting the customers and put them off.</p>
<p>For example, my ISP provides those that subscribe to one of the better packages with credits for their (WMA-powered) online music store. You don&#8217;t pay for it 1:1, it&#8217;s all included in your subscription. A nice idea, it keeps people from downloading pirated music &#8230; or does it?</p>
<p>In the past, I&#8217;d &#8220;buy&#8221; my albums at the store, then proceed to a P2P site to download the MP3s, including coverart and intelligently named files (rather than &#8220;artistid_tracknumber_trackname.wma&#8221;). Technically speaking, I didn&#8217;t do anything bad, I didn&#8217;t share those MP3s with anyone and I was able to listen to them on the device of my choosing (I have / had quite a few devices and I dislike the idea of losing 50% of my media library because of device lock-in). I didn&#8217;t even bother downloading the WMA-encrypted files, why waste bandwidth after all?</p>
<p>So, you won&#8217;t believe how happy I was when I first discovered the goodness that is <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">MagnaTune</a>. Sure, they haven&#8217;t signed any uber-famous acts like Britney Spears or Robbie Williams (who&#8217;d want them anyway?), but that doesn&#8217;t mean that any of their artists aren&#8217;t great musicians. All of the performers are screened and the team from MagnaTune then decides who actually gets to be included in their portfolio.</p>
<p>While that is a a good feature on it&#8217;s own, here&#8217;s what I really love about them: when you buy a CD, you get to decide how much you pay for it. Say, if you&#8217;re short on cash, you could spend a couple bucks, burn that CD, then impress your girlfriend with it while you propose to her. She accepts and you&#8217;re so thankful that you decided to buy the CD again and now pay a bigger amount. Granted, I&#8217;m quite sure this hasn&#8217;t happened (yet), but it&#8217;s one way to describe their pricing policies.</p>
<p>When you buy a CD, it&#8217;s up to you how you want it. There are quite a few different formats, high and higher bitrate MP3, FLAC, WAV, everything really. And if you happen to lose your music along the road, you just hit up their re-download form and you&#8217;ll get a mail with all your music downloads again, at no extra charge, naturally.</p>
<p>Another thing I love is that with every album you purchase, you get three tickets to give away to friends. They can then download the same album you bought for free. Sure, you <em>could</em> send out more tickets, but then again, why hurt those that try to please you?</p>
<p>Like every good web-based company, they have a <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/">blog</a> available, with lots of great information, should you be looking for more reading. Oh, and they&#8217;re working on a <a href="http://london.redmood.com/blog/2007/01/under_construct.html">Second Life space</a> too.</p>
<p>Another company that just gets it is <a href="http://www.candyrat.com/">CANDdYRAT Records</a>. Like MagnaTune, they have a nice selection of artists in their line up. They approach marketing in an innovative way, if you ask me. I am, like most people, too busy to go out and look for music, I&#8217;d much rather get a list of suggestions (just like <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> and <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> do) and then take my pick.</p>
<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been using YouTube to discover new music and came across a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn4MGaS3N4">great clip</a> called Drifting from Andy McKee. The whole clip is available on YouTube and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=rpoland">the user</a> that uploaded it, who actually is the owner of CANdYRAT Records, had another 44 videos available for my entertainment.</p>
<p>I was so fascinated by the Andy McKee stuff that I kept watching clip after clip. His music sounds great, but I&#8217;m quite sure I wouldn&#8217;t have bought it if I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten a chance to see the guy in action. Thanks to the use of some innovative marketing of his assets, Mr. R. Poland managed to turn a listener into a customer and so I decided to order my very own copy of the &#8220;Art of Motion&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ordering the CD didn&#8217;t go down without a hitch though, the first time I tried, Paypal asked me for a credit card, even though I had enough funds in my account to cover it. After asking for some assistance from CANdYRAT Records, I was quickly presented with alternate solutions. In the end, I tried again with Paypal a day later and it just worked. During the whole order process, I received quick replies to emails whenever I had a question and was finally told that my order would arrive in 7 to 10 business days.</p>
<p>Well, what do you know - 2 business days (not counting Saturday, where postal service is, technically speaking available) later, I received a small package with <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/15987-2/IMG_2170.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[53]">the CD</a> I longed for.</p>
<p>With both companies, support has been great. I wasn&#8217;t hassled by any DRM-schemes, I received personal support whenever I had questions and paying for the media was easy too. So if you&#8217;re looking to expand your media library, have a look at both <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">MagnaTune</a> and <a href="http://www.candyrat.com/">CANdYRAT Records</a>, maybe you&#8217;ll find your new favorite artist(s) there&#8230;</p>
