	<div class="main">
		<p>Normally, I refrain from posting entries that contain a political message, even if it is only remotely political, but this one really deserves some air time:</p>
<p>According to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/08/17/blocked-in-turkey/">blog</a>, Turkey blocked access to <a href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>, Automattic&#8217;s hosted blogging service.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> was blocked because of a video that insulted  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Insulting the founding father of that Nation, apparently, is a criminal offense, punishable with a prison sentence. The interesting thing though is that the video was not posted by a Turkish national, but rather by a Greek critizen.</p>
<p>During the past couple of years, Turkey has struggled to gain admission to the European Union and they have done a great deal to improve various <del datetime="2007-08-18T05:24:18+00:00">shortcomings</del> situations for which I commend them.</p>
<p>However, it <em>really</em> does make me wonder if a country that kills access to a blogging service because it does not agree with the views stated on said site has the right character to join a community as diverse as the European Union.</p>
<p>After all, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_symbols#Motto">motto</a> of the EU is <em>&#8220;united in diversity&#8221;</em>. Thinking about the recent events regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Turkey">freedom of speech in Turkey</a>, I, for one, am unsure how the European diversity compared with the Turkish way of dealing with journalists (and those that dare to voice their opinion) could possibly fit together in a peaceful way.</p>
<p>For the record, I do realize that the way the government acts does not necessarily resemble the way many Turks would act, but when it all comes down to a black and white picture, the government was elected as a representative of the Turkish citizens &#8230;</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 12th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Every once in a while, I come across a great song that just kicks in the way many songs do not.</p>
<p>First up is <em>These Arms</em> from Matt Costa. I heard this song in the second season finale from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unit">The Unit</a>, a TV show that combines drama and action the right way, even better than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAG">JAG</a> managed to do.</p>
<p>The song stuck with me, mostly because of the scenes that it was used in during the season finale, and if you have seen it and look at <a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/matt-costa-these-arms-lyrics.html">the lyrics</a>, you will know why.</p>
<p>The song is available on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=zkPOYhRd-eQ">YouTube</a> with great audio quality. Disregard the video though, since that is not part of Costa&#8217;s masterpiece but rather a collection of clips from Veronica Mars.</p>
<p>Second spot goes to Mo&#8217;Jones&#8217; <em>Runnin&#8217; Blind for you</em>. Although the musical style is different to many of the other artists I enjoy, this easy going song really makes me smile. Not just because of the story that is told, but also because the whole idea of the song is so true for many people; we often let good chances pass by without making a (our) move.</p>
<p>Lyrics are available at the <a href="http://www.mojones.nl/songs/runnin.html">official site</a> and the original clip is up on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=c7vXYSKw1wU">YouTube</a>, go watch.</p>
<p>Finally, there ain&#8217;t no reason you should be missing out on a song from Brett Dennen, called <em>Ain&#8217;t No Reason</em> (yes, yes, cheap pun, I know).</p>
<p>Like <em>These Arms</em>, I first discovered this song in an episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unit">The Unit</a>, again, with a very fitting scene. It appears that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Dennen">Dennen</a> also saw some airplay in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy">Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</a>, which makes him even cooler.</p>
<p>Again, a deep and meaningful song with very <a href="http://www.sweetslyrics.com/309497.Brett%20Dennen%20-%20Ain't%20No%20Reason.html">interesting lyrics</a>. I found a good quality version of the song on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=zA2Se20IWKU">YouTube</a> and while the clip links up with the military theme of <em>The Unit</em> it is not related to the TV show.</p>

		<h2 id="post-116"><a href="../../../../2007/08/12/why-i-prefer-linkedin-over-facebook/index.html" rel="bookmark">Why I prefer LinkedIn over Facebook</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 12th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>While reading today&#8217;s news feeds, I came across this <em>very</em> interesting item on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/11/facebook-source-code-leaked/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We just received a tip that the source code for the Facebook main index page has been leaked and published on a blog called Facebook Secrets.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I am no PHP guru, the code looks legit, as far as I can tell and that really makes me wonder: If someone can get to the most treasured part of a web application, its sourcecode, how easy would it be for an attacker to grab all my, non public data from my profile? How easy would it be for people that should not have access to my data, to actually create a profile on me and spam me even more?</p>
<p>Everyone always hypes how great Facebook and the Facebook API is and while it is not yet clear if the API contributed to the breach or not, it could still have been a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Facebook then gave an official statement, <del datetime="2007-08-12T10:11:03+00:00">trying to blame a misconfiguration</del> <ins datetime="2007-08-12T10:11:03+00:00">stating that it was a misconfiguration</ins>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of Facebook’s source code was exposed to a small number of users due to a bug on a single server that was misconfigured and then fixed immediately. It was <strong>not a security breach</strong> and <em>did not compromise user data</em> in any way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Techcrunch&#8217; Nik Cubrilovic then stated that:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems that the cause was apache and mod_php sending back un-interpreted source code as opposed to output, due to either a server misconfiguration or high load</p></blockquote>
<p>High load? One would expect that, with a site like Facebook, the developers / company behind the whole application would take precautions so that there are no leaks like this.</p>
<p>Either way, this kind of breach is probably next to impossible with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>. Reason for that is, if you ask me, the fact that they do not give everyone access to their servers / services (by means of a, supposedly badly coded API) and even if they would, I am more than certain that LinkedIn would have appropriate resources so that no server could experience that kind of high load that triggers it to reveal sourcecode.</p>
<p>Virtual hat tip to <a href="http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2007/08/11/facebook-indexphp-source-code-leaked/">Elliot C. Back</a></p>
<p>[UPDATE]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blakeross.com/">Blake Ross</a> kindly <a href="../../../../blog/media/why-i-prefer-linkedin-over-facebook/index.html#comment-406">pointed out</a> that the way this post was written suggested that part of TechCrunch&#8217;s statement was actually the official Facebook statement. It is not and I stand, humbly corrected.</p>
<p>Misquoting aside, I am still not happy about the fact that Facebook suffers this kind of problem right amidst their <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/25/facebook-in-court-with-connectu-press-conference-at-3-pm-pst/">legal troubles</a> and it does make one wonder if this was a deliberate attempt or really, just a misconfiguration.</p>

		<h2 id="post-113"><a href="../../../../2007/08/07/the-things-that-keep-you-coming-back/index.html" rel="bookmark">The things that keep you coming back</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/marketing/index.html" title="View all posts in Marketing" rel="category tag">Marketing</a> on August 7th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>In today&#8217;s (commercial) world, everyone seems to be focused on one thing and one thing only: money. Many companies forget that without customers, they would not be where they are right now and yet, some companies still believe they can treat their customers the way they want.</p>
<p>Normally, this kind of post would turn into a rant, but I think it is important to point out those companies that actually care about their customers and will do (just about) everything to keep you coming back:</p>
<p>First up is <a href="http://www.qhnetworks.com/">QH Networks</a>. I came across them while looking for some professional help on getting a new Operating System installed on my server. Since I value my data and like to be kept in the loop, I bombarded one of their employees with a myriad of questions during the whole project. I had special requirements and special circumstances, yet they did not give up on me and move on to the next, probably more profitable client. By doing so, they earned my respect and I will most certainly come back when I am in need of their services again.</p>
<p>Next stop is <a href="http://proporta.com/">Proporta.com</a>. I initially came across them in 2003, while looking for some accessories for my Pocket PC and while I am not ordering from them every other week, they are always the first site that I check. The reason for that is simple: their employees are very responsive and in the rare case that your order cannot be shipped out the same day, they will try to, and actually do, their level best to keep you happy as a customer. It is not so much the reparations they are willing to make but their concern for you as a customer. Granted, said concern is probably based on the fact that they want to keep you as a customer, but still, they care, while others do not. And besides that, Proporta.com includes a selection of <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20206-2/IMG_3305.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[113]">English Breakfast Tea</a> with every order, a small gesture, yes, but one I like a lot.</p>
<p>Both of these companies work harder to keep you as a customer than most other companies you will ever come across. It may be related to their respective area of operations, which are more niche than your ordinary brick and mortar store or it may be related to the fact that their employees actually give a damn. Either way, it works out very nicely for the consumer.</p>
