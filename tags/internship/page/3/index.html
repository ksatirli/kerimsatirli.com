		<p>When I first pitched the idea of me doing my internship at <a href="http://www.xolo.tv/">xolo.tv</a>, I was offered a chance that few interns get: I could pick my own project. Now, you have to understand that my <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a> has some guidelines as to what an intern should do, but technically speaking, everything that <em>xolo.tv</em> had available, fell within those guidelines and I had <em>carte blanche</em>.</p>
<p>In the past years, I have learned that having <em>cojones</em> is one of the main ingredients that you need if you plan on making a difference and that, dear reader, is something I want(ed) to do at <em>xolo.tv</em>, to make a difference.</p>
<p>At a highly dynamic company like this, with a high output of deliverables, finding something that actually makes a difference can be rather difficult, unless you are foolish enough to propose to deliver a solution that works faster (in terms of time), costs less (in terms of usage) and offers a more customized feature package; the fact that this solution is one of the core components of the <em>xolo.tv</em> platform is just additional icing on the cake.</p>
<p>What it is exactly that I am doing is something I cannot tell you, due to an NDA I signed, suffice to say that it is important, interesting and even innovative.</p>
<p>While we gear up for the release, you might want to check out a few of the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/internship_xolo/">pictures</a> we took &#8216;around the office.</p>
<p>Being offered a chance to work on something like this is, simply put, <em>freakin&#8217; awesome</em> and very educative at the same time and I figure that the best way to finish this report is by giving you something to think about:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ain&#8217;t nothing like a man that can do what he wanna&#8230;</p></blockquote>

	<div class="main">
		<p>When I <a href="../../../../blog/personal/on-moving-internationally/index.html">moved</a> to the Netherlands a couple of years ago, my parents decided to choose the beautiful town of <a href="http://www.oss.nl/">Oss</a> as our hometown.</p>
<p>While there is nothing wrong with Oss in itself, after all, this is the city where the world&#8217;s most famous anti conceptive, the anti-baby pill, originated, Oss&#8217; location is anything but close to the place <a href="http://www.xolo.tv/">xolo.tv</a> is located in, <a href="http://www.amsterdam.nl">Amsterdam</a>.</p>
<p>What this basically means is that I get to enjoy the Dutch Public transport on a (close to) daily basis and as such, have made some interesting discoveries:</p>
<p>I have been commuting by train from Oss to Breda for more than two years now and have not had a single month withouth any delays, but never had more than two days with delays directly after each other &#8230; until now.</p>
<p>My first day at xolo.tv started with me nearly being late, not the kind of first impression you wanna make, not even if it is out of your own control and since the Dutch Railway operators love consistency, I was graced with delays of ten to fifteen minutes <em>every</em> day of my first week.</p>
<p>On my normal route, from Oss to Breda, ten minutes do not matter, because the same train I enter in Oss, is the same one that takes me straight to Breda but the situation is quite different when you are going to Amsterdam. There is at least two trains, at worst three, which means less consistency for the traveller.</p>
<p>And consistency is something I start(ed) to depend on: interning in Amsterdam is great, travelling close to four hours every day - not so much, because when you have to change trains all the time, your sleeping pattern gets all mixed up and my body, for one reason or another, is very unappreciative of that.</p>
<p>On a more interesting note, however: since I am interning in Amsterdam, I am actually getting more sleep than I did before, due to the fact that I simply cannot stay up too late anymore and also thanks to the downtime I have in trains, downtime that is used to sleep and just let my mind relax.</p>
<p>Back on topic, however, public transport. When you travel a lot, you get to meet a number of interesting or funny people and you experience a whole range of peculiar situations.</p>
<p>Commuting during rush-hour means that trains are crowded and everyone is longing for a place to sit; me on the other hand, I do not mind standing for one part of the journey, after all - sitting is what I do at the office (when we are not playing with the frisbees that is).</p>
<p>So the other day, while I was standing near one of the exits, I noticed another male who was fascinated by the amount of people that had to use the John (his words). He had been traveling with the same train for about half an hour at that point and completed another part of his journey (an additional 45 minutes) with me.</p>
<p>The guy literally made a listing of people using the toilet and his total count, after an hour and fifteen minutes, came down to 26 people. His conclusion was that some chef somewhere the day before had probably screwed up royally and that, in turn, prompted that much bowel movement.</p>
<p>I know that, sometimes, we should just stop to admire the little things in life, the things money cannot buy, I am just wondering if the things this guy was fascinated with are those <em>small things</em> (no pun intended)&#8230;</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/college/internships/index.html" title="View all posts in Internships" rel="category tag">Internships</a> on January 26th, 2008 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>In the past years, I have <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kerimsatirli">worked</a> for a great number of companies; they all served a different purpose – while one was purely about content generation, another was producing software and yet another focused on the building of websites for corporate communication.</p>
<p>I have long been fascinated by what is called the “social web” and it is with great pleasure that I can finally announce what a handful of people have known for about a month now: I am the latest intern to join Dutch-American start-up <a href="http://www.xolo.tv/">xolo.tv</a>.</p>
<p>I was in the fortunate position of being able to choose from a handful of different companies for my first internship, but in the end, the products that <em>xolo.tv</em> are developing are the ones that appeal to me the most.</p>
<p><em>xolo.tv</em>’s platform was first introduced to me back during <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/picnic07/index.html">PICNIC’07</a>, when <a href=” http://mindcaster.wordpress.com/ “>Marc van Woudenberg</a> gave an impromptu presentation to a number of people during an early dinner, after the conclusion of the <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/european-bloggers-conference-friday-recap/index.html">European Bloggers Conference</a>.</p>
<p>I seeded quite a bit at PICNIC with my custom-made <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20955-2/IMG_3360.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[175]">moo.com LinkedIn</a> cards and Marc was one of the lucky recipients but since I did not have enough time to actually get a good talk going, I figured that nothing much would come of it.</p>
<p>For one reason or another however, Marc got back to me and after studying <a href="http://kerimsatirli.com/tags/internship/page/3/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/kerimsatirli%E2%80%9D">my profile</a> on LinkedIn and approached me to set up a meeting for November 2007. Hah, take that all you <em>nay</em>-sayers who think that LinkedIn cannot be used to get a job!</p>
<p>To be honest, I had no real clue as to what to expect from the talks up-front. Marc seemed to think highly enough of me to devote some of his valuable time to a meeting. I was impressed, plain and simple, but at the same time puzzled, so puzzled that I did not know how to prepare for the meeting and did all I could: learn about all past clients of <em>xolo.tv</em>, create a presentation (yes, just in case) on how they could expand their customer-base and</p>
<p>I had never had a formal interview, mostly because I always gained “access” to a job by sweet-talking my way in, not that there is anything wrong with it, but it is a totally different thing than what happened at <em>xolo.tv</em>.</p>
<p>What impressed, yet at the same time, scared me the most was the warm welcome I received. I burst in during lunch (which just so happened to be a tradition their <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/24688-2/IMG_0413.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[175]">other intern</a> started) and was invited to join them and grab a bite to eat.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, the talks started where I got a chance to showcase <a href="../../../../blog/college/cooking-20/index.html">cuizine.tv</a> and was then cross-examined by a number of <em>xolo.tv</em> employees and finally, after receiving a number of interesting and not that easy to answer questions, I was left with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>I knew one thing and that was that I wanted to work there. I also knew that the people working their all are specialists in one way or another and I somehow had to find a reason to convince them, because, frankly, I just had to do this, if not only for the reason that one of the clients was <a href="http://www.blof.nl/">Bløf</a> (yes, it’s true and yes, this was not my main motivation).</p>
<p>During the course of the meeting, Marc expressed his interest in setting up a follow-up meeting for December 2007 and it is safe to say that I was starting to get a good feeling about the whole deal.</p>
<p>The second meeting was much easier-going, basically all we did was sign a few papers and grab some drinks to celebrate, all the while discussing the secrets and intricacies of the female mind - go figure.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>As part of my Bachelor&#8217;s Degree, I am currently doing an internship at <a href="http://media.xolo.tv">xolo.tv</a>, a company that focuses on a number of things that revolve around social media, video production and media sharing.</p>
<p>While the biggest part of my internship consists of actually interning and learning new things, a small part of the whole experience (and a rather big part of the grade) is related to keeping a journal that is accessible to anyone who is interested.</p>
<p>Considering that I am very proud of being able to intern at <em>xolo.tv</em> and at the same time too lazy to set up a new blog, just for the purpose of writing weekly reports, I figured that I might as well post my reports <a href="../../../../c/blog/college/internships/index.html">here</a>.</p>
