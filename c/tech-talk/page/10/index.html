	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on February 2nd, 2005 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>You&#8217;re in a hurry, a client just called - you have to move out. No time for the coffee you just ordered, you pack your things and leave. Being a mobile professional however, you carry around a lot of stuff with you - like your notebook, your Pocket PC and your Smartphone.</p>
<p>You got your phone in one hand, laptop under the other, but wait - where is your Pocket PC? Fifteen minutes later you realize that it&#8217;s still guarding the cup of coffee in Starbucks&#8230;</p>
<p>How are you going to tell your boss that you left your $500 Pocket PC in Starbucks? How are you going to explain that all the important data you have on your Pocket PC is out of your reach? That&#8217;s going to be tough, luckily however, there are companies out there that know how to counter such problems:</p>
<p>Stuffbak is one of those companies. The idea behind their product is the following: People want to return lost items, so do police agents and employees at Starbucks, an airport and the staff from a sports event. However, it&#8217;s pretty hard to do so if your device doesn&#8217;t contain any information that is accessible without a password, or if your device doesn&#8217;t contain any personal data at all - like iPods, your designer glasses or your brand new digital camera.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I was skeptical about the product. Many questions were screaming for an answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Could something that costs a mere $1.95 actually protect a device worth $2000 and will the product be easy to use?<br />
- How easy can it be removed, and will it be eye pleasing or ugly?
</p></blockquote>
<p>StuffBak felt that they could answer my questions and sent me a selection of their products, so I could protect my assets. Mind you, I&#8217;m located in the Netherlands but StuffBak says it&#8217;s no problem at all and since an honest finder can report the items via the web as well. I actually have high hopes that I will get my items back if I lose them.</p>
<p>Once the labels arrived it took me only a few seconds to attach them to the various items I wanted to protect. However, it took me a few minutes to find a good place. Granted, an honest finder will probably look on all sides of your device, but why complicate it? I choose a place that is easily visible and yet isn&#8217;t in full view.</p>
<p>Naturally the best place for this purpose is the underside; I really wouldn&#8217;t recommend putting the label inside a battery<br />
compartment since most &#8220;technology illiterate&#8221; people wouldn&#8217;t know how to get there and hence the StuffBak protection wouldn&#8217;t work that well for you.</p>
<p>I also found that after attaching the label you have a few seconds which you can use to peel of the label and reattach it, once you press it down - it&#8217;s over. The tag is about as easy to remove as a small rock. Prior to attaching the label, I cleaned the surface with a cleaning spray I normally use to clean my devices from dust and dirt. I can&#8217;t really comment on if this will have any effect on the durability of the labels but it sounded logical to me to do so first.</p>
<p>Another thing I like about the labels and tags is that they have a great design. The colors, an eye-pleasing cocktail of golden-yellow / golden-orange combined with silver and black give them a distinct look and make them very easy to spot. Yet, the design does not decrease the visual value of your device in any way.</p>
<p>Once the tags and labels were attached, I had to activate them, which consists of the following steps: First you go to StuffBak&#8217;s site and click on activate label, you then get to select from various categories like bags, electronic accessories and many more.<br />
Your selection then requires a sub-selection where you specify what kind of item you want to register. Following that, you enter as much data as possible, including model, serial number and you also have a field for a description in which I always entered the color, contents (if applicable) as well as characteristics.</p>
<p>You then get the chance to offer an optional cash reward, which is a good idea if you register expensive items like your laptop or Pocket PC. Most of the times, the information on those items is more valuable than the device itself, and an optional cash reward may entice people to return it faster. StuffBak also prints the words &#8220;reward for return&#8221; on their labels and tags, and I strongly believe that this entices more people to return something.</p>
<p>Apart from an optional cash reward, StuffBak also offers every finder $20 worth in labels, so they can in return protect their items. Pretty nice move I&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>All in all, I can say that I am sleeping better now, knowing that my items are protected by a great service. Okay, people still can choose to NOT return your items, but at least I know that I did everything possible to give finders a chance to act the honest way. I consider these tags, as inexpensive as they are a real essential for all the mobile professionals out there.</p>

		<h2 id="post-12"><a href="../../../../2005/01/17/carrying-around-your-office-in-style/index.html" rel="bookmark">Carrying around your office - in style</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on January 17th, 2005 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Years ago a mobile professional was anyone with a mobile device, no matter if it was a Palmtop, a cell phone or a notebook. Nowadays lots of people could be considered mobile professionals based on the old &#8220;law&#8221;.</p>
<p>Carrying around a cell phone is standard, a Pocket PC or Palmtop depending on your job as well. If you have to do more typing a laptop replaces your PDA or is used in addition to one. Entertainment isn&#8217;t stationary anymore either.</p>
<p>With HD MP3 Players for dumping prices, flash-based MP3 Players nearly for free, many of us find themselves carrying those around as well&#8230;</p>
<p>Students have to carry around even more so; as a fact, I know that most of my friends at least carry a cell phone, a notebook and a MP3 Player with them on a daily base, and of course - the obligatory books, folders and note pads.</p>
<p>Being a student is not cheap and you want to protect your expensive study materials, naturally - the same is true for your devices and thanks to companies like RadTech, you can carry around your &#8220;stuff&#8221; without looking awkward.</p>
<p>Enter the Curve, one of the many shoulder bags RadTech sells. Big enough to accommodate a 17&#8243; notebook, I consider this the cream of the crop amongst shoulder bags. Having used many bigger ones, none of them amazed me as much as the Curve.</p>
<p>When you first look at the Curve&#8217;s features you see that this bag wasn&#8217;t just created &#8220;for fun&#8221; but rather with students and mobile professionals (who&#8217;d rather carry around a nice bag instead of a boring suitcase) in mind.</p>
<p>Since this object is a shoulder bag, the most natural way to carry it is - of course - on your shoulder. Even after long hours of use, the Curve didn&#8217;t feel inconvenient to wear. Carrying it around fully loaded, which comes down to about 25 liters, was not uncomfortable at all However, if you want to, you can just carry it on the rubber handle and carry it like a standard suitcase (albeit, a good looking one).</p>
<p>For the times where you don&#8217;t want your bag to sling around, the manufacturer of the bag ensured that you can use a strap around the back of the bag. Adjustable in length and even height, this feature protects your bag and it&#8217;s contents from dangling around and damaging anything.</p>
<p>I found this particularly great to use while riding a bike or jogging to a course I was late for.</p>
<p>What I liked about the Curve was the fact that, even when it was strapped to your body, you could easily reach any devices in it, much like bags couriers use on their deliveries. The accessibility also takes me to my next point - the plethora of pockets, bags and compartments you will find:</p>
<p>On the outside cover, which is of course padded with as much as 0.5&#8243; of foam everywhere, you will find 3 zippers, one being for a smaller compartment in the middle of the cover - which could be used for chewing gum, notes, invoices and similar stuff.</p>
<p>Then there is the Media Player compartment which will accommodate your i-Pod, any MP3 Player or a CD-walkman. Thanks to a hole at the top of the cover, you can connect your headphones without having to fear that your movement will open the zipper and your device will fall out. The third pocket is at the lower end and can be used for just about anything. The bonus that it&#8217;s made of see-through mesh makes it easy to spot your items.</p>
<p>When you open the cover, you will find a flap that protects a compartment which is used to store up to 3 pens, a key chain and there are two smaller pockets, one with a zipper which is about perfect for a flat wallet. The other one is again constructed using a see-through mesh.</p>
<p>Moving from the outside to the inside you will at first see a big area and not immediately spot the left and right compartments. This happens to be a side effect of the way this bag was built and I believe if it would fall down, that this construction will seriously protect the contents.</p>
<p>Of course, when you carry around a USD 1.500+ notebook, the one thing you don&#8217;t want to feel / hear is that it&#8217;s jumping around inside your bag. This is one fear you will never have to experience with the Curve.</p>
<p>If your device is smaller than 15.5&#8243; you can use the padded sleeve inside the Curve, without the brief, you can even carry up to 17&#8243; big notebooks. Personally, I found the sleeve pleasing to use, especially with the padded handle, you basically have a bag-in-a-bag, which you can just take out when it&#8217;s convenient for you and you don&#8217;t feel like carrying around the Curve itself. The only downside about the sleeve is that it accommodates only a notebook, there is no pocket for CDs, which you might want to have with you at all times.</p>
<p>Above mentioned sleeve is protected from falling out of the bag through a velcro-closing latch that keeps the sleeve in place. These velcro-latches are also used on the opposite side of the bag to keep two devices in place. The size of those two pockets are built to fit a bigger cell phone and a Pocket PC or PalmOne device. On the front-side of the sleeve pocket, which is on the opposite side, you will also find a little space to store cables, media or anything else for that matter.</p>
<p>Filled up like that, you still have a lot of room left which you can use to store your books, or - if you are so inclined - a gaming system like an X-Box or a PS2, you certainly have enough for that.</p>
<p>The Curve is available in a charcoal combo with either blue or red and costs USD 74.95. Certainly this is not the cheapest bag you will find out there, but this bag is not like your ordinary bag. Packing more features than any student bag, yet being more versatile than a simple laptop brief, the Curve, to me, is the Rolls Royce of bags and it definitely looks cool.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a good all around bag that is more versatile than most other bags.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a>, <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Tech Talk" rel="category tag">Tech Talk</a> on January 6th, 2005 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>The idea of eBooks has been around for some time now, I&#8217;m guessing 10 years at least, if not longer, but &#8220;the thing&#8221; never really gained any momentum, at least - that&#8217;s what I thought. Luckily though, I turned out to be wrong &#8230;</p>
<p>In the beginning, eBooks were plain text files - no formatting, no links to a dictionary, no enhancements like sounds / images. Fast-forward to 2001: Microsoft introduces the &#8220;Microsoft Reader&#8221;, a tool that enables users to read eBooks in the .lit format. Adobe joins the market not long after, trying to sell PDF as the perfect eBook format and naturally there are other companies, like <a href="http://www.ereader.com/">eReader</a> (<a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/photos/favorite_mobile_programs/ereader.html">James</a> loves them) and  a few less known alternatives.</p>
<p>Long story short: eBooks are anything except a dying market. There are quite a few shops out there that sell works in the different formats and since I had a bit of money on my PayPal account and didn&#8217;t want to bother with all the fees they charge you to have the money transferred to your bank account I went out on a shopping frenzy and bought eBooks worth $100 at my new favorite store, <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/">Fictionwise</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been some time since I read an eBook - to be honest - the first eBook I read was also the last one I read. It was a short story, written in German by <a href="http://www.mynetcologne.de/~nc-sommerma3/">Marcel Sommerick</a>. The author&#8217;s story was awesome, but since it was no real .lit file, the &#8220;read&#8221; was not as pleasant as it could have been: no chapter marks, no images - no nothing&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, I felt it was in order to give eBooks a second chance and hence bought a few interesting works from well known authors such as Dan Browns (I only read Angels &#038; Demons and The Da Vinci Code), but also some books from rather less known authors.</p>
<p>The thing I like about Fictionwise is their cyberguide, basically a tab that shows you what other buyers of the same book read. Yes, amazon.com has the same feature, but it just happens that amazon&#8217;s suggestions never do it for me. Fictionwise&#8217; suggestions on the other hand are spot on 1 out of 2 times. Sure, the feature is there to turn first time-buyers into returning customers and to keep returning customers, but I like it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll certainly make sure to post something about the eBooks in the future. I&#8217;m interested to see how it will turn out - positive or negative?!</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on December 8th, 2004 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>During the last half year, quite a few Bluetooth headsets have been released by different manufacturers. One of them is Bluetake&#8217;s i-Phono BT420EX.<br />
I recently acquired a set and have been using it over the past few weeks. Want to know if it is ready for Prime Time yet? Read on&#8230;</p>
<p>Some people might remember the first generation of cordless headphones, built using RF technology. I had one of those, they were quite expensive at the time they were released, and a recent search on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22RF%20headphones%22">RF headphones</a>  shows that such products are still available.</p>
<p>The headphone I am discussing however, is using Bluetooth technology. The official designation is &#8220;i-PHONO BT420EX Bluetooth Hi-Fi Sports Kit&#8221; and it is in fact much more than a &#8220;simple&#8221; headphone.<br />
