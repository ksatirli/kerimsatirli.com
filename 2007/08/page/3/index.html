	<div class="main">
		<p>Dutch cross media network <a href="http://www.immovator.nl/">iMMovator</a> <a href="http://www.immovator.nl/cross-media-zomercafe-speciale-editie-met-minister-ronald-plasterk">kicked off</a> the new season of their <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20964-2/IMG_3398.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[129]">CrossMediaCafe</a> events yesterday with an interesting event.</p>
<p>The guest of honor was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Plasterk">Ronald Plasterk</a>, Minister of Education, Culture and Science. When asked as to what kind of technology he uses in his daily life, he made a remark about his recent vacation to Bali, stating that &#8220;<em>he uploaded a couple of eps of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28TV_series%29">24</a> to his iPod so he could watch them during his trip</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Naturally, the above statement should be taken with a grain of salt, after all, can one <em>really</em> trust politicians? Political views aside however, Plasterk struck me as authentic. He listened to what people had to say and provided insight into why he did certain things.</p>
<p>This was only the second time I met a Minister and the first time I actually liked the guy. Very non-condescending and approachable. No fancy security guys to shield the guy from the audience and a highly likable appearance.</p>
<p>His statement on Blackberry usage during cabinet meetings was great too: &#8220;my mother taught me that it is very inappropriate and plain jerk&#8217;ish to not look someone in the face when they are talking to you&#8221; (this is not verbatim, but Plasterk&#8217;s statement came down to that)</p>
<p>Later on, Paul Rutten from <a href="http://www.inholland.nl/">Hogeschool InHolland</a> commented that Blackberrys actually increase the efficiency of people and as a user of these kind of technologies, I would have to agree, nonetheless, the point Plasterk makes about it being rude still applies.</p>
<p>One of the keynotes also contained some interesting information. It appears as if one third of the dutch IT / creative industry seems to be concentrated around the so-called Noordvleugel, namely Amsterdam and Hilversum with a respectable growth and many small, innovative companies. It might not be Silicon Valley yet, but it may put us on the next <a href="../../../../blog/media/fast-cities-2007/index.html">Fast Cities</a> listing.</p>
<p>Then came the, for me, highlight of the whole conference - Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten speech on Entrepreneurship and ways of becoming an entrepreneur in today&#8217;s world and how he became the man he is today.</p>
<p>The speech was hands down the best thing about the whole conference / meeting because Boris dares to show that all you need is some big cojones and the strength to get up when someone tries to knock you down. For those that are interested, head on over to <a href="http://bomega.com/2007/08/21/spoken-column-text/">bomega.com</a> and read the speech, it is definitely worth it.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20967-2/IMG_3387.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[129]">Boris</a>, the Dutch educational system is not built for success and only breeds &#8220;hive workers&#8221; that have little to no ambition to advance in their profession. This is being backed up by the fact that only 7% of Dutch students actually plan on setting up their own company, compare that to the 70% of American students and that&#8217;s <em>&#8217;nuff said</em>. Just about everyone in the Netherlands who goes into higher education, does that for the sole purpose of finding a job where you can apply for, people lack the motivation to come up with something innovative.</p>
<p>In the end, <a href="http://www.bomega.com/">Boris</a> says, it all comes down to selling yourself (or your product, for that matter) the right (successful) way.</p>
<p>Pitching is something we do 24/7; at your company, when you try to convince your boss that you need more funding for that awesome idea you have, with your co-workers, when they do not feel like working late but you still need them and of course, with your significant other, when you need them to sign off on your next big purchase.</p>
<p>Boris thinks that the Netherlands (although, this would apply to any country really) would do a lot better, internationally speaking, if presentation skills would carry a higher importance in the educational system. With <em>&#8220;only one oral presentation every year, as opposed to one oral presentation EVERY week in the US</em>&#8220;, it is no wonder that our students are scared of pitching something.</p>
<p>The lack of serious presentation skills (or should that be: the serious lack of presentation skills?) was also obvious during some of the showcases speeches:</p>
<p>First up was Wobble, a product from <a href="http://www.momentuminteraction.nl/">Momentum Interaction</a>. Wobble is a piece of wood you can step on and use as a kind of enhanced joypad. The system can be connected to a PC and gathers an array of data that can be used for medical purposes.</p>
<p>While the system in itself is nice enough, the suggested price of more than $4,000 made me laugh. For one, the system, in its current state is a long way from actually being production-ready and moreover, 18 months ago, I came across a similar system at my own college, which was built over the span of nine weeks as opposed to ten months (which was the time Momentum Interaction needed).</p>
<p>The &#8220;home&#8221; version of Wobble will have an approximate price of $150 to $250 and will be easier to set up. It does make one wonder how a device that costs $4,000 for medical usage, can end up at less than 1/10 of the price in a retail customer&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Any consumer will expect a range of games that can be used with the device and the looks and usage would have to be improved too, all factors that would drive the price up as opposed to down, yet Momentum Interaction thinks that the home product can be sold at that price.</p>
<p>I am no analyst, but seeing what &#8220;<a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">our guys</a>&#8221; came up with really makes me think if the approach that was used for Wobble was the right one &#8230;</p>
<p>The second showcase was <a href="http://www.stoneroos.nl/">Stoneroos</a> which was, no offense to the presentator, the worst presentation I have ever seen. Did someone forget to tell the lady that folding your hands is a no-go for presentations? Oh and &#8220;uhm&#8221; and &#8220;err&#8221; do not work that well either.</p>
<p>This may be out of line, seeing how Stoneroos is an accomplished company with a <a href="http://www.stoneroos.nl/portfolio/clients">nice portfolio of clients</a>, but wow, one would expect that as a CEO, you would have the time to prepare a well thought out and clear presentation and do a dry run at least once to get some feedback.</p>
<p>Stoneroos&#8217; product itself, the iFanzy (whats with the &#8220;i&#8221; by the way?) is a solid product but I wonder why I would want to use that , limited, platform as opposed to something along the lines of Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>One of the guests commented that Stoneroos lacks focus; their product portfolio includes electronical program guides, games and other services and you can tell that Stoneroos is trying to be a Jack of all trades; at the cost of being a Master of none.</p>
<p>The third showcase was about <a href="http://www.wunderwall.nl/">Wunderwall</a>, a product that enables you to utilize the wisdom of crowds for various tasks on your computer. While the name in itself is not really something I would go for (it might work great in a German speaking locale), the product in itself is an innovative and useful solution.</p>
<p>Wunderwall enables multiple users to take part in the presentation / application that is displayed on a screen, allowing everyone to interact with the various elements. The &#8220;mutliple users, single location&#8221; principle was well thought through and the presentation was great too. No Dick Hardt, but still better than the other showcases.</p>
<p>The final showcase was about AVI Drome, a product from <a href="http://www.parkpost.nl/">ParkPost</a>; the product in itself did not catch my interest, simply because it is very location specific and not geared towards home / office users but rather companies in the (audio / visual) media creation sector.</p>
<p>Boris claimed early that the number one angst in the Netherlands is giving a presentation and looking at how badly half of the showcases was delivered, one must really wonder how it is that <a href="http://generation-next.nl/">a student community</a> can find a better selection of showcases for their events than a national <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20970-2/IMG_3391.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[129]">cross media network</a>.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on August 20th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Ever since the release of mobile storage devices, people have repurposed their gadgets to store important, often even confidential data on them. While there is nothing wrong with that per se, many users seem to forget the various security issues that could arise if someone were to get a hold of your Pocket PC and its unencrypted content.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://iliumsoft.com/">Ilium Software</a> however, there is an application you can use to get the best of both worlds: carry your important data with you, wherever you go and still keep it safe and protected behind a layer that is as difficult to break as your password.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Size</strong></p>
<p>On last count, my eWallet storage was 226 cards big (or does that count as huge already?). These cards are made up of roughly 120 logins for various things, software license keys, two dozen of personal items such as drivers license, SSN and all those other numbers you cannot ever remember but still need all the time and also a few select items such as <em>&#8220;doing CPR the right way&#8221;</em> and other medical items. Yes, believe it or not, that is what I use eWallet for, too.</p>
<p>I consider myself an eWallet power user and as such, I would like to share a hint with you: take a bit of time to analyze the data you use the most inside your eWallet database(s). I have four main categories, in the root of the wallet file and nothing else, no stray cards, no nothing.</p>
<p>Every one of these categories is prefixed with a number so if I have the SIP open or am on a PC, I can just type the number to jump to the category. The naming of the categories is a scheme that is similar to one that I use for email folders and groups in <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">my chat application</a>. This way, I already know the basic structure of the data underneath.</p>
<p>eWallet&#8217;s category feature is as simple as it is powerful. Set up the right way, it will save you a lot of time, but if you are not specific enough, you might end up wasting time as opposed to saving it.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Buddies</strong></p>
<p>Ilium Software&#8217;s eWallet is one of those applications that you can use on just about every mobile device you use, including Pocket PCs, Smartphones, Palmtops and even on U3 drives.</p>
<p>The Desktop version of eWallet also includes <em>SyncPro</em>, which handles the various syncing tasks. Besides the standard device-to-device syncing, eWallet also lets you sync your wallet file with a Windows Share, FTP server or <a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/ew/ew_istorage.htm">iOmega</a>.</p>
<p>To answer a question of paranoid users: yes, the FTP syncing feature is plain FTP, which means that someone could sniff out your password. This does <em>not</em>, however compromise the data stored within your wallet file. That data is protected by a 256 bit encryption, which is twice as much encryption as most banks offer.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Chain</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the main application and the syncing conduit, there are also two versions of <em>PassBuilder</em>, one that is installed on your device and one that is available <a href="http://passbuilder.com/indexjs.html">online</a>. PassBuilder, as the name suggests, is used to generate secure passwords.</p>
<p>A number of options enable you to generate the kind of password you can remember best, be that in the form of a mnemonic sentence or as part of a dictionary word.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Design</strong></p>
<p>To visually enhance your listing, eWallet includes a feature that lets you select an icon to represent the content of the card. This works amazingly well with software license cards and even can be used to include a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">Favicon</a> for a website login.</p>
<p>Besides icons, eWallet also lets you add sounds and (background) images that are played / displayed whenever a specific card is accessed. If you feel like customizing your wallet file even more, you might want to read about a long lost feature on <a href="http://blog.iliumsoft.com/?p=227">Ilium Software&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Shop</strong></p>
<p>In case the message <em>still</em> is not obvious, I love <a href="http://iliumsoft.com/site/ew/ewallet.htm">eWallet</a>. I have been using it for years now and you should be using it too. eWallet is as great as it sounds; it protects your data and works across a huge group of different devices (and platforms).</p>
<p>For approximately $30, you can <a href="http://www.clickapps.com/moreinfo.htm?pid=6672&#038;b=TECHTALK">get the professional suite</a>, which makes a lot more sense than just buying the Pocket PC (or Smartphone) version, because once you are hooked on storing data in eWallet, you will not want to be creating your cards on a small slide-out keyboard.</p>

		<h2 id="post-127"><a href="../../18/a-better-way-of-waking-up/index.html" rel="bookmark">a better way of waking up</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 18th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>It is said that, the way a person wakes up defines their mood for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>For me, this is definitely true, if I wake up with a bad mood, I will most certainly be cranky throughout the day, but if I wake up in a relaxed kind of way, I will be able to go about my daily routine in a much more positive way.</p>
<p>One thing I love after waking up, no matter which time it is, is music. Not that I do not love music in the evening or during the day, but a few good tunes here and there can get you started into your day and are as important to me as a good breakfast.</p>
<p>The other day, I was looking for some relaxing music, I came across a software called <a href="http://www.mywakeuptunes.com/home.htm">MyWake-UpTunes</a>, which supposedly makes your waking up experience <em>&#8220;a good one&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>While the software seems to be nice enough, the thing I really like is their <a href="http://www.mywakeuptunes.com/productInfo/soundtrack.htm">soundtrack</a>.</p>
<p>Composed by <a href="http://www.willmusser.com/">Will Musser</a>, these tunes are a collection of <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20625-1/mywakeuptunes.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[127]">energizing</a> and inspiring tracks that are simply a pleasure to listen to, not just in the morning but whenever you are looking for some music to tone down a little and get rid of some stress.</p>
<p>Go grab yourself a copy, you will not regret it.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 18th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Normally, I refrain from posting entries that contain a political message, even if it is only remotely political, but this one really deserves some air time:</p>
<p>According to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/08/17/blocked-in-turkey/">blog</a>, Turkey blocked access to <a href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>, Automattic&#8217;s hosted blogging service.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> was blocked because of a video that insulted  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Insulting the founding father of that Nation, apparently, is a criminal offense, punishable with a prison sentence. The interesting thing though is that the video was not posted by a Turkish national, but rather by a Greek critizen.</p>
<p>During the past couple of years, Turkey has struggled to gain admission to the European Union and they have done a great deal to improve various <del datetime="2007-08-18T05:24:18+00:00">shortcomings</del> situations for which I commend them.</p>
<p>However, it <em>really</em> does make me wonder if a country that kills access to a blogging service because it does not agree with the views stated on said site has the right character to join a community as diverse as the European Union.</p>
<p>After all, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_symbols#Motto">motto</a> of the EU is <em>&#8220;united in diversity&#8221;</em>. Thinking about the recent events regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Turkey">freedom of speech in Turkey</a>, I, for one, am unsure how the European diversity compared with the Turkish way of dealing with journalists (and those that dare to voice their opinion) could possibly fit together in a peaceful way.</p>
<p>For the record, I do realize that the way the government acts does not necessarily resemble the way many Turks would act, but when it all comes down to a black and white picture, the government was elected as a representative of the Turkish citizens &#8230;</p>

		<h2 id="post-125"><a href="../../17/spb-mash-up/index.html" rel="bookmark">Spb mash up</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/rants/index.html" title="View all posts in Rants" rel="category tag">Rants</a> on August 17th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>After writing my last two reviews on both <a href="../../../../tech-talk/reviews/your-mobile-phone-booth/index.html">Spb Phone Suite</a> and <a href="../../../../tech-talk/reviews/shell-of-choice/index.html">Spb Mobile Shell</a>, I came to the conclusion that Spb really needs to do one thing: mash up.</p>
<p>As a mobile power user, you most certainly have at least one, if not multiple Spb products installed on your device. While there is no problem at all with that, Spb would be well advised to just create <em>one</em> application that contains all the features people need, namely:</p>
<p><strong><em>from Spb Pocket Plus:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explorer: ZIP Support</li>
<li>Explorer: Properties</li>
<li>Pocket IE: save image</li>
<li>enhanced <em>close</em> button</li>
<li>useful shortcuts on Today screen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>from Spb Mobile Shell:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>big icons menu</li>
<li>World Time</li>
<li>Now Screen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>from Spb Phone Suite:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(automatic) Profiles w/ Wireless Settings</li>
<li>Call Filtering</li>
</ul>
<p>That is all there is to it. Put all those things into one application and you will have a(nother) bestseller. The codebase is there already and while I am no developer myself, I do not believe this would take <em>that</em> long to implement.</p>
<p>Yes, Spb released their <a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/products/communicationpack/">Communication Pack</a>, but that still is not what I am looking for. The communication pack, while offering two out of three of the applications that this mash up would require, is really only a software bundle, not <em>one, single</em> application.</p>
<p>So, Spb, how long until you release this application?</p>
