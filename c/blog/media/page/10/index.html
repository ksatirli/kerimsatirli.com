	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on September 25th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>The summer is (finally) coming to an end and the only show worth watching during the summer break, <a href="http://www.scifi.com/eureka/">Eureka</a> only has another two episodes left before it, too, goes on hiatus (with no word on a possible third season yet).</p>
<p>Fret not though, for all is not lost: the third (and fourth) week of September generally marks the beginning of the Fall season for TV shows and therefore also means that a number of great series will either start or continue.</p>
<p>Last year around, I only really discussed one show, <a href="../../../../../blog/media/jericho-isnt-just-a-town-in-the-west-bank/index.html">Jericho</a>, which, incidentally will return for a second season, sometime mid-season - which can be anywhere from November to March.</p>
<p>Jericho was first canceled and then renewed only a couple of days later, thanks to the doing of many, many fans that kept sending nuts (an insider reference to the last episode) to <a href="http://www.cbs.com/">CBS</a>, Jericho&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>If you have never seen Jericho, I suggest you either try to catch the re-runs, or grab yourself the <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/B000SQFC2C/">DVD</a>; in any case, you will not regret me exposing (yes, another insider reference) you to this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Wars around the globe</strong></p>
<p>Last May, <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/the_unit/">The Unit</a>, another CBS hit show, concluded with a breathtaking finale that left more than a handful of questions open. Tonight, September 25th, the third season&#8217;s premiere will start answering a couple of these questions.</p>
<p>The best way I can classify <em>The Unit</em> is by calling it a military-social-drama, which means that there is a lot of shooting, some killing, a couple of nice explosions, <a href="../../../../../blog/media/three-great-songs-you-should-listen-to/index.html">a <em>great</em> song</a> and of course the really dangerous things, these elite soldiers face: the home-front which consist of adultery, lies and other niceties.</p>
<p><strong>Save the cheerleader &#8230; then what?</strong></p>
<p>NBC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/">Heroes</a> was one of the most successful series last year, with an approximate 14 million viewers during the premiere as well as a place in the &#8220;Top 10 TV Shows of 2006&#8243; ballot from the American Film Institute.</p>
<p>The second season kicked off yesterday and continues where the first season left off - in feudal Japan and although I could give you a synopsis of the first episode, it is best not to spoil anything. Heroes, simply is too great a work of (modern day filming) art to not experience it on your own time.</p>
<p>On a related note: close to the end of the 2007 / 2008 season, Heroes: Origins will premiere, which will feature six episodes, with one new <em>hero</em> in every episode, at the end of the mini-series, viewers will get to vote which will be allowed to return in a third season.</p>
<p><strong>From Stargate to Atlantis</strong></p>
<p>On September 28th, this Friday, the SciFi channel will premiere the fourth season of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/atlantis">Stargate: Atlantis</a> and for the first time, this will be the only Stargate franchise that will kick-off at that day.</p>
<p>Season 10 of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/stargate">Stargate</a> was concluded last May, after more than 200 episodes, which, incidentally, made it the longest running science fiction show, just a few episodes ahead of <em>The X - Files</em>.</p>
<p>The new season will bring a number of changes, such as one of the main characters from Atlantis giving up her job and another main character from Stargate: SG1 taking up her place. Apart from that, the fourth season will also feature the return of crowd-favorite Dr. Beckett, who passed away in the latter half of the third season.</p>
<p>The great thing with scifi is that you can, one way or another, revive people and while there were no plans to bring back Beckett at first, fans of the show around the world <a href="http://www.savecarsonbeckett.com/">united</a> in order to bring back the <em>heart of Atlantis</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Interns and Relationships</strong></p>
<p>Apart from Stargate: Atlantis, <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/">Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</a> will also start it&#8217;s fourth season this Thursday, September 28th, which, too, will answer a great number of open questions on the status of the various relationships between, among and across the various actors.</p>
<p>One day prior, Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8217;s spin-off <a href="http://abc.go.com/fallpreview/privatepractice/index?u=0">Private Practice</a> will start its 13 episode season. The show will focus on the life of one Dr. Montgomery after she left Seattle Grace Hospital and heads down to the Los Angeles area in order to, well, join a private practice.</p>
<p><strong>Shanks and Shackles</strong></p>
<p>While not as good as all-time favorite prison show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118421/">Oz</a> in my opinion, Fox&#8217; <a href="http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/">Prison Break</a> just kicked off its third season a week ago and once again tells the story of two brothers who &#8220;got each others backs in times of need&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the first two season took place mostly in the North American part of this world, the third season features a plot in Panama with a selection of new threats, new fish and questionable alliances.</p>
<p><strong>The (silent) clock</strong></p>
<p>Much later this season, January 13th, 2008 to be precise - everyone&#8217;s favorite counter-terrorist Jack Bauer will return for season 7 of <a href="http://fox.com/24/">24</a>. Contrary, however, to the previous six season, Bauer will not be the same &#8220;guy&#8221; anymore; Season 7 will be very different to what we have grown accustomed too and will feature a much darker plot.</p>
<p>It is expected that season 7 will introduce a (number of) plot(s) that will be concluded during the eight season, which is as far as Fox went with pre-ordering new episodes.</p>
<p><strong>3, 2, 1 &#8230; cut!</strong></p>
<p>All the above shows have been hand-picked by me, they represent my personal taste and my personal taste only. The shows range from drama to action to thrillers to science fiction and the only thing they really do have in common is that they all provide a great source of entertainment.</p>
<p>Not all of the above mentioned shows are safe for young children, so make sure you know what your kids are watching.</p>
<p><ins datetime="2007-09-26T22:15:36+00:00">[UPDATE]</ins></p>
<p>For those that are curious, <em>The Unit</em>&#8217;s new theme song is called <em>Walk the Fire</em>, by Robert Duncan, the guy who also made the theme for the first two seasons. Both tracks are available for listening at Robert Duncan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.myspace.com/robertduncan">MySpace</a> page.</p>
<p><ins datetime="2007-10-03T17:59:47+00:00">[UPDATE #2]</ins></p>
<p>I just came across <a href="http://www.visiteureka.net/news.html?nid=152">this bit</a> on the premier Eureka fansite <a href="http://www.visiteureka.net/">VisitEureka.net</a> that states:</p>
<blockquote><p>SCI FI Channel has greenlit production on a third season of its most-watched Original Series Eureka, ordering 13 new hours of the dramedy.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, come summer 2008, Eureka will be returning for a third season, <em>yay</em> for that.</p>

		<p>When I first met <a href="http://nsnelson.wordpress.com/">Nate</a>, I knew that I had found one of those rare people you have an immediate link with; you share the same thoughts at the same time and it starts to become magical.</p>
<p>Nate and I are both passionate about what we do, what we have done and what we will be doing and we agreed that it was time to start doing something together and so we started to work on <a href="http://www.nachotalk.com/">NachoTalk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>NachoTalk is a blog that focuses on social and cultural commentary, with viewpoints from two writers on opposite sides of the Atlantic (hence the tagline). We also may occasionally stray from that that formula and post something a little more lighthearted than the usual topics.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nate and I both started writing articles a couple of weeks ago and decided that the best way to handle things was to go for a two-weekly schedule; one week Nate publishes an article, the next week I do and so on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nachotalk.com/i-aint-no-millionaires-son">Our first</a> contributions <a href="http://www.nachotalk.com/we-dont-need-no-education">are online</a>, so feel free to hop over and enjoy our new project.</p>
<p>That said, thanks go out to Kevin, <a href="http://www.benreedy.com/">Ben</a>, Phillip, <a href="http://unikoeln.facebook.com/profile.php?id=245700020">Emma</a>, <a href="http://www.mattersofconversation.com/">Gabriele</a>, Joel, <a href="http://brocku.facebook.com/profile.php?id=89906160">Katie</a>, <a href="http://svagis.wordpress.com/">Darren</a> and a couple of others for providing us with feedback during our soft-launch period, you rock guys (and gals, of course).</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="../../../../../blog/projects/techy-shirts-catchy-slogans-and-pirates/index.html">last year</a>, I actually (very last-minute) created a shirt to commemorate this <em>very important</em> event, only to find out that I wasn&#8217;t getting much chance at wearing it today because I had a day off.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, it is good to see that TLAP day has cast its wave across the web like a new schooner would:</p>
<p>The <del datetime="2007-09-19T16:11:32+00:00">guys</del> pirates at Iliumsoft are giving you a chance at getting 50% off of <em>any</em> title if you dare to call and speak like a real pirate, arrrrrr!</p>
<p>The land lubbers at CrunchGear are giving you a chance at <a href="http://crunchgear.com/2007/09/19/talk-like-a-pirate-win-2gb-ram/">winning 2GB of RAM</a>, again, for talking like a pirate.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world is simply enjoying the day &#8230;</p>
<p>In case you have not gotten your pirattitude on, head on over to the official TLAP page for some information on <a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com/howto.html">how to pronounce words</a> like a real sword buckler.</p>
<p>The TLAP team also created a nice video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/2cKCkbWDGwE" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Talk like a Pirate Day!">the 5 As every pirate should remember</a> and a funnny <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/AM1NUGlo2ww" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Talk like a Pirate Day Song">song</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="post-492"><a href="../../../../../2007/08/31/we-dont-need-no-education/index.html" rel="bookmark">We don&#8217;t need no Education</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 31st, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>I am a student. I have been as long as I can remember and I will be as long as I can keep remembering (stuff). I am also the son of a teacher, tutor and language specialist.</p>
<p>You see, I was born and raised in a multi-cultural, sometimes-traditionally European family. My parents hail not only from different countries, but from different continents and as such, I had the privilege of being able to immerse myself in a number of other cultures at a rather young age.</p>
<p>Through that very immersion, I was (and, indeed, still am) not only able to understand other cultural traits and traditions better, but I also gained a lot of insight into how my own culture is being thought of by outsiders.</p>
<p>This kind of understanding of course, is not only limited to cultural items but also expands into areas such as education and <em>success</em> and that is indeed what I am going to talk about today.</p>
<p>Before we start, I should probably give you some background information on my (educational) past, simply because I believe that this way, you will be able to see where I am coming from:</p>
<p>In the past decade, I attended five different high schools and one college. I have taken part in a number of non-secondary education related events such as language courses both in-country and on-location and have seen and, of course, experienced more different learning / teaching methods than most people can shake a stick at.</p>
<p><small>Note that I am not saying that my experience is beyond exhaustive, but I do believe that I have gotten a fair amount of information on this topic.</small></p>
<p>Now, after two years of college and various talks with students and teachers from around the world, I have come to the conclusion that us Europeans don&#8217;t need no education, or at least not like it is now anyway.</p>
<p>Education, without a doubt, is important, very important in fact and while I am not going to go as far as saying that people without proper education are less important members of a society, we all know that the better educated you are, the more options your future (and present) has for you.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that educational systems were put in place to prepare you for life, to enable you to become a good, heck, great, member of society and contribute as good as you can to the greater good of the whole.</p>
<p>But, I ask you, what good is education that fails to do the one thing you <em>really</em> require: prepare you for life?</p>
<p>The most important part about, well, just about everything, is being able to present yourself, your product, your project, your team, &#8230; your anything and not just presenting it, but presenting it the <em>right</em> way.</p>
<p>I have been to a couple of (international) conferences in the past years and if there is one thing that I noticed it is that those speakers and hosts that know how to <em>&#8220;work&#8221;</em> the audience, generally are able to sell their product, be it a service or a thought or simply an idea, are always more successful than those that have no clue about giving a presentation.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, it seems that eight out of ten times, the bad speakers are of European descent and the great speakers are, most of the time, of American descent or at least have found a way to rid themselves of the European way of presenting and it makes me wonder, why is it like this?</p>
<p>I have talked to educators in the past and I am still talking to educators on a daily basis and many of them seem to be deadlocked in their ways, not realizing that not only they are keeping themselves from learning something new, but also are putting unnecessary obstacles on the road to success of us European students.</p>
<p>The problem is that our education system is, dare I say, hell-bent on training students to become hive-workers, there is little to no incentive to teach us, or at the very least, show us the ways of being a hive-queen.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, for example, there are exactly two universities that teach classes around the subject of entrepreneurship. During high school, students, in general, give no more than five, maybe six presentations in front of a group of other students.</p>
<p>Translated into numbers, this means that only 8%, that is, less than one tenth, of all Dutch students are thinking about creating a start-up, the other 92% are, more or less, looking toward a job that provides safety until the age of 65 and a good pension.</p>
<p>Only a handful of students are willing to take a chance and there is a deep set angst of risking some (human, financial) capital and either succeeding or falling flat on the floor and that is the problem.</p>
<p>Europe, all in all, has very few failing economies, most countries are stable and provide good working environments. <em>The man</em> even stimulates many new companies with financial contributions and, if need be, even with the right knowledge that is needed to start a company.</p>
<p>Yet, whenever I have heard people asking for or giving advice business advice, it always comes down to “<em>go for the stomach</em>”, which means nothing else than to shoot for the market that everyone is going for, because there is little risk involved and a moderate chance of small-time success, &#8220;<em>one would not want anything else&#8230;</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Eight per cent, you really have to stop a minute and think about that number. Now take into account that approximately half of those eight per cent will not make it past the three year mark and we end up with less than one twentieth part of the student populace.</p>
<p>This prompts the question as to why are we not taught to <em>go for the throat</em>, take that long shot with a big chance of missing and a small (tiny?) chance of actually hitting it off big.</p>
<p>The answer: social environment. Family, significant others, friends, coworkers – all of them are conditioned, by our educational system, to tell you that following through on a brilliant idea simply is not done, well, not done in Europe anyway.</p>
<p>On the other side of the pond, your friends would most likely encourage you, tell you to go through with it, heck – the worst thing that could happen is that you burn a bit of money and have to go look for a new job or return to your old day job.</p>
<p>The problem is the mindset of the bigger part of Europeans: The views are simply black and white, you either win, or … you fail. There is no “you may have failed but you gained valuable insight” option. Annoying, to say the least and dangerous to the economies of Europe at best, dangerous because it robs Europe of many talented people, basically turning Europe into one big classified.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/homepage/index.html">Fast Company</a>, already presented one part of the bill to us Europeans this summer with their <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/100/open_fast-cities.html">Fast Cities</a> listing:</p>
<p>Out of a listing of thirty cities, only five are part of the European Union. The reason for this low number is simply that people with the right ideas would rather move overseas (that is, the United States) than to spend their time here, because, again, it comes down to the <em>social environment</em> issue.</p>
<p>And honestly, I can not blame but one of them. I, too, would rather move to a country where the whole &#8220;thing&#8221; is set up to enable me to create something amazing from scratch. A place where I do not have to shell out twelve large ones only to get a company started.</p>
<p>In closing, let me say this: If you are a student, do yourself and those that come after you, a favor and beg, no, <em>FIGHT</em> for changes that will enable you and your peers to compete with the American economy, but most of all: do not be afraid to shoot to kill&#8230;</p>
<p>Take a minute to think about what you want to be able to look back upon at the end of your life - &#8220;<em>a sheltered and risk-free life</em>&#8221; or a life full of accomplishments?</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on August 31st, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Yesterday evening, the guys from <a href="http://thenextweb.org/">The Next Web</a>, <a href="http://www.fleck.com/">Fleck,</a> <a href="http://www.wakoopa.com/">Wakoopa</a> and <a href="http://www.twones.com/">Twones</a> invited a select audience to <a href="http://www.feest.je/">Feest.je</a> in order to celebrate their recent successes with the respective companies and introduce a couple of new features.</p>
<p>Wakoopa launched <a href="http://blog.wakoopa.com/archives/new-design-and-some-cool-features">a new design</a> and Fleck showcased a couple of new features and the guys from <a href="http://www.twones.com/">Twones</a> provided some interesting insight into their upcoming release.</p>
<p>Getting to know the right people is not impossible at such parties, but it certainly is harder if you do not own a company that is in the news every other day. Getting to know the people that matter is even harder, especially if you do not have some kind of (paper) business card.</p>
<p>While I do not like the idea of a (paper) business card on its own, simply for the fact that the information can not be updated easily nor can you decide who gets which information (it is: all or nothing), I do understand that even though it is called a Web 2.0 community, paper still sways its scepter over the way contact information is shared.</p>
<p>Since I do not own a fancy <a href="http://www.synapticate.com/">company</a> or <a href="http://www.wizcode.com/">work</a> for someone that plays in the Web 2.0 scene, I figure that there is little to no information I could put on a business card that would make it worth the paper.</p>
<p>Something I am happy with, however, is my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kerimsatirli">LinkedIn</a> profile, because it showcases some of the things I have done and I personally enjoy staying in contact with my contacts on a serious platform which just works a lot better for me than, say, Facebook.</p>
<p>With LinkedIn, if you want to connect with another person, you only really need two things: a name and an email address and that is exactly what I put on my <em>hand-outs</em>:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20955-2/IMG_3360.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[137]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20954-2/IMG_3360.JPG" alt="LinkedIn: Kerim Satirli" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have any stats yet, but I think the cards worked pretty well. Mostly because of their unusual format and because they are a <em>no-nonsense way</em> of communicating those bits of information that are important.</p>
<p>The product in itself, unfortunately, is no official LinkedIn item and not sanctioned by the powers that be, but I figure that this could be of interest to more people.</p>
<p>Naturally, &#8220;pimping&#8221; yourself is important, but one should never go to a party without bringing at least something, some kind of gift, for the host(s).</p>
<p>Truth be told, I <del datetime="2007-08-31T15:33:23+00:00">had</del> have a gift for the hosts, the only problem is that it was delivered today, on the day that <em>Feest.je</em> was originally slated to happen and not yesterday, the revised date for the party.</p>
<p>That said, what do you give someone who has a beautiful <del>wife</del> partner and kids and more web properties than you can shake a stick at? Exactly, something he does not have and the answer to what it actually is will follow soon.</p>
