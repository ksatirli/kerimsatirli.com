		<p>Although I got myself a <em>La Fonera</em> only a month ago, I decided to get myself a <em>La Fonera+</em> in order to enjoy <a href="http://www.fon.com/">FON</a> even more.</p>
<p>Since I love wireless surfing and Dutch walls are known for their Fort Knox&#8217;ish thickness which can be very counterproductive to your signal strength, I also decided to add a <a href="https://shop.fon.com/FonShop/shop/ShopController?view=product&#038;product=PRD-ANT01">La Fontenna</a> to the order. Somehow, that seemed to make a lot more sense to me than building <a href="http://www.bright.nl/magazine">my own</a>.</p>
<p>It still amazes me how simple the whole setup process is: plug it in, connect at least one cable (ADSL) and you can enjoy the various bonuses of the FON community.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/media/marketing/index.html" title="View all posts in Marketing" rel="category tag">Marketing</a> on August 7th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>In today&#8217;s (commercial) world, everyone seems to be focused on one thing and one thing only: money. Many companies forget that without customers, they would not be where they are right now and yet, some companies still believe they can treat their customers the way they want.</p>
<p>Normally, this kind of post would turn into a rant, but I think it is important to point out those companies that actually care about their customers and will do (just about) everything to keep you coming back:</p>
<p>First up is <a href="http://www.qhnetworks.com/">QH Networks</a>. I came across them while looking for some professional help on getting a new Operating System installed on my server. Since I value my data and like to be kept in the loop, I bombarded one of their employees with a myriad of questions during the whole project. I had special requirements and special circumstances, yet they did not give up on me and move on to the next, probably more profitable client. By doing so, they earned my respect and I will most certainly come back when I am in need of their services again.</p>
<p>Next stop is <a href="http://proporta.com/">Proporta.com</a>. I initially came across them in 2003, while looking for some accessories for my Pocket PC and while I am not ordering from them every other week, they are always the first site that I check. The reason for that is simple: their employees are very responsive and in the rare case that your order cannot be shipped out the same day, they will try to, and actually do, their level best to keep you happy as a customer. It is not so much the reparations they are willing to make but their concern for you as a customer. Granted, said concern is probably based on the fact that they want to keep you as a customer, but still, they care, while others do not. And besides that, Proporta.com includes a selection of <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20206-2/IMG_3305.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[113]">English Breakfast Tea</a> with every order, a small gesture, yes, but one I like a lot.</p>
<p>Both of these companies work harder to keep you as a customer than most other companies you will ever come across. It may be related to their respective area of operations, which are more niche than your ordinary brick and mortar store or it may be related to the fact that their employees actually give a damn. Either way, it works out very nicely for the consumer.</p>

		<h2 id="post-112"><a href="../../06/exhaustion-in-the-modern-world/index.html" rel="bookmark">Exhaustion in the modern World</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/personal-stuff/index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on August 6th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>According to an old proverb, <em>Haste makes waste</em>. Applied to the modern World, this would mean that, the more stressed out you are, the more susceptible to a host of bad things you will be..</p>
<p>Grab a <a href="http://www.nrc.nl/next/">newspaper</a> or read <a href="http://evelien-online.blogspot.com/2007/07/out.html">a blog</a> and you will come across at least one person that is having to cope with the results of an insanely busy life. Students, according to recent studies generally sleep between five to six hours a night, a lot less than the recommended eight hours and of course, voice their opinions about this. Teachers, too, are experiencing increased stress; colleges want more money, which means more students and more tutoring for teachers.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there is the self-inflicted stress. Most of us have been there, the place where you are faced with a decision: <em>deadline</em> or <em>sleep</em> and from my own experience, I know that I always go for <em>deadline</em>. At college, we occasionally joke about this, after all, you can sleep all you want once you are dead&#8230; We also joked about the fact that, approximately six years after we all graduated, at least one third would be suffering from burn out.</p>
<p>Funny as it may sound at first, this is becoming a huge problem. Yes, there are those among us that can easily cope with little to no sleep and still function normally, but there are even more among us that can not cope with even one hour less sleep, much less three to four hours less. Yet, many people of these two groups are subject to the same amount of stress and once it turns sour for them, it often ends in a burn a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29">burn out</a>.</p>
<p>Classified as a psychological condition, burn outs are, in fact, very capable of inflicting harm to a person&#8217;s physique. Studies generally state that EMTs and Air Traffic Controllers are very prone to this condition, because, after all, stress comes with the territory in those jobs, but more and more statistics are facing that suggest that even the most mundane job can lead to a burn out.</p>
<p>How that happens, in many cases, is not totally clear, but I suspect that it has to do with the way we are conditioned to live our lives. No helpful advice from me this time, just something I was discussing with a <a href="http://nsnelson.wordpress.com/">friend</a> some time ago.</p>
<p>An old proverb says that <em>the bow needs to be unsprung once in a while or it loses its spring</em>. What this means is basically that the more stress you subject your body (and mind) to, the more often you will need to give yourself some time to relax. If you do not occasionally &#8220;reset&#8221; yourself, your <em>bow</em> ( = mind) will not serve you as well as it did in the past.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is not only limited to your professional life but also embraces your social life. Sometimes, stress makes you perform better, but too much of it will ruin your abilities and appetite and will make you lose interest in many things you enjoyed before, simply because you are incapable of handling anything because you are too exhausted.</p>
<p>So, keep in mind that you need to blow off some steam every now and then, because all the action you see is worthless if you end up not being able to enjoy it because you are too exhausted to leave your bed for more than a couple of hours at a time.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, people ask me why I devote time to blogging, after all, it is one of those pastimes you do not earn much ‘cred with on the streets. Which, obviously is not entirely correct, but that is not the point.</p>
<p>The reason I do this is simple, I like to share my thoughts with the world, and occasionally, the world replies and tells me heartwarming things like this:</p>

		<h2 id="post-110"><a href="../../04/thumbs-up-2/index.html" rel="bookmark">Thumbs Up!</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/guides/index.html" title="View all posts in Guides" rel="category tag">Guides</a> on August 4th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Pocket PC are becoming more and more of a replacement for small time computing. They may not yet be able to replace your office PC for a 100% but typing a long email, doing some mobile blogging or other input sensitive tasks is no uncommon thing anymore.</p>
<p>In recent years, a number of devices have been released with integrated keyboards and you can of course always attach an external keyboard to your device, but there is still a huge amount of Pocket PCs that have to rely on Software Input Panels (SIP) to get the job done. With such a big (potential) customer base, it is only natural that companies will try to come up with solutions that make your life easier.</p>
<p>One of these solutions is TenGo Thumb, a SIP that is big enough to be used with your thumbs (yet, it still works very well with a stylus). The application is aimed at people that want to <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19926-1/tengo_thumb_2.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[110]">input</a> data quickly and easily on the go, without going through the additional hassle of pulling a stylus out of its silo.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of thumb</strong></p>
<p>After installing <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19924-1/tengo_thumb_1.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[110]">TenGO Thumb</a> and starting any application that requires text input, you will be presented with a choice to either skip or follow the TenGO Thumb tutorial. While you could use the SIP without any training, I would recommend you to go through the included tutorial, for the simple reason that more advanced things like spelling words that are not yet in your dictionary, are hard to do if you have no clue as to how you can activate such a feature.</p>
<p>TenGO Thumb&#8217;s biggest advantage over many other large-button SIPs is that it includes a predictive text input feature called the TenGO core engine. With it, you can easily <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19930-2/tengo_thumb_4.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[110]">type words</a> and just as easily go back and <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19932-2/tengo_thumb_5.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[110]">correct</a> the word(s) you typed. Another useful feature of TenGO is that it stores your most used words at the most left part of the list, which can help if you type the same words a lot. You can see, in part, how the engine works, by looking at the characters that are displayed in the small box on the right hand side.</p>
<p><strong>Thumbing a ride</strong></p>
<p>Now, all of this is certainly very interesting, but we all know that a picture speaks a thousand words, so I decided to create a short video clip of someone typing an email, because, if a picture is able to speak a thousand words, this clip will speak volumes.</p>
<p>The clip is available in a variety of flavors, you can watch it right now in your browser, by going to the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/kerimsatirli/tech-talk/reviews/tengo-thumb/tengo_thumb.flv.html">Flash version</a> (4.7 mb), or you can download a smaller WMV version <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/kerimsatirli/tech-talk/reviews/tengo-thumb/tengo_thumb_wmv.html">here</a> (2.4 mb).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the typing is a lot faster than the screen recorder is capable of recording and as such, you only see one third of the keys actually being hit.</p>
<p>Another thing that you are <em>not</em> seeing is that I am actually using my thumbs to type the email. Based on the visual setup of TenGO Thumb, which basically comes down to six large keys for the various characters, typing long texts becomes a lot easier.</p>
<p><strong>Thumb Problem</strong></p>
<p>When I first came across TenGO Thumb, I installed it on a Windows Mobile 2003 device where it worked without a hitch. Then came my new Pocket PC and I installed the SIP there too but I had trouble activating it. In two out of five cases, the keyboard would not open and the only way to get it working again was a soft-reset.</p>
<p>Soft-resetting your device all the time, while harmless, gets annoying really quick and so I contacted the TenGO support team. I have to admit that I have not met support guys that walk the extra marathon (yes, marathon, not just mile) for a future customer like TenGO did. A dozen possible ways to solve the problem later, I ended up removing some of the (preinstalled) O2 applications from my Pocket PC and voilà the keyboard opens whenever I need it and I have not had a problem with it since.</p>
<p><strong>Thumbs up or down?</strong></p>
<p>All in all, <a href="http://tengo.net/tengo_thumb.html">TenGO Thumb</a> is a great piece of software and makes typing on Pocket PCs without a keyboard a lot easier and a lot more efficient. Even with big thumbs, you will not face any problems and with predictive text input, you will be typing away at your first mobile novel in no time. At a mere <a href="http://www.digibuy.com/cgi-bin/order.html?xrgomics+112010248784">$12.95</a>, this application is a steal and will pay for itself in no time.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, TenGO Thumb gets a definite thumbs up from me. The only downside I can see with this application is that you might be able to damage your screen if you are using your device without a <a href="../../../../tech-talk/reviews/urban-armor-for-your-personal-assistant/index.html">good screen protector</a>.</p>
