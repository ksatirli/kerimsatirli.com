		<description>Paul - you're most welcome. You are actually correct, I noticed that you were talking about a related, but still different topic when I re-read my notes. The thing that stuck most with me was you mentioning the things a Journalism student has to do.</description>

		<description>Thanks for the link, Kerim - was great to meet you - although I should correct you and say I didn't talk about what it takes to be a journalism student! I invited attendees to send me their experiences of blogging/citizen journalism in their countries so I can bring them to a Western audience.</description>
