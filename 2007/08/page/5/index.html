	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on August 13th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>When the first Pocket PCs and Smartphones hit the market, it was obvious that they were targeted at managers and other professionals that needed to have access to a mobile computing platform that was not as cumbersome to carry around as a notebook. It was obvious because of the price that was attached to the devices and because of the type of cases that were available&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Cowhides versus cosmetic surgery left-overs</strong></p>
<p>Managers and the likes often have leather briefcases, leather wallets and would, obviously, also be looking for leather cases for their mobile devices. And since most markets are willing to adopt the <em>demand and supply</em> basics, you will be able to find a great amount of eTailers and retailers with the best in leather cases.</p>
<p>Me, personally, I am not much of a leather guy and as such, I would rather see my device covered in some high tech material as opposed to a piece of dead animal. While searching for an adequate case for my XDA Flame, I came across <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20210-2/IMG_3306.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[119]">Proporta&#8217;s Silicone Case</a>.</p>
<p><strong>mostly-identical twins</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you notice when you open the package from Proporta, is the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20206-2/IMG_3305.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[119]">complimentary English Breakfast Tea</a>. A small but nonetheless kind gesture if you ask me and also one of the reason <a href="../../../../blog/media/marketing/the-things-that-keep-you-coming-back/index.html">I keep ordering stuff</a> at Proporta.</p>
<p>Installing the case is very easy. In fact, Proporta considers the installation so easy, that they did not even include a manual. While making a remark about that, I was told that &#8220;even a baby could install it without a manual&#8221; and I guess that that is true, but still, a short leaflet with some basic information on how to install and care for an installed case would have been great.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20210-2/IMG_3306.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[119]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20212-2/IMG_3309.JPG" alt="XDA Flame Silicone Case" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From left to right, the case has the exact same visual layout as the device itself. The case itself comes in a black that matches the device very well, but also has a slight downside: other than the D-pad, you will not be able to see the back light of the buttons, so operating your device during low light conditions might be harder, especially if you have trouble remembering the button layout. Other silicone cases from Proporta come in a white-to-transparent color and with those cases, the back lit keys make more sense.</p>
<p><strong>XDA Flame, meet James Bond</strong></p>
<p>On a brighter point (no pun intended), the case features all the cut outs you will need to keep using your device. As you can see <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20216-2/IMG_3311.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[119]">here</a> and <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20219-2/IMG_3318.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[119]">here</a>, Proporta did a great job on re-creating the whole layout, both with the buttons, as well as with the cut outs.</p>
<p>However, the cut outs do not stop at the various ports or camera openings, but also include the two locks to the left and right (mostly used for car holders, I believe), the stylus as well as the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20222-2/IMG_3322.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[119]">front-side camera and status LEDs</a>. You can sync and charge your device and even use the IR port while it is in the case with no problem at all.</p>
<p><strong>See me, feel me</strong></p>
<p>The silicone case feels good and I am sure that this is not related to the fact that I am male, but rather to the texture of the whole product. The case sits in your palm nicely and will not slide out unless you loosen your grip on it.</p>
<p>The Pocket PC inside the case is protected from all sides, except for the screen. While this is not really a downside of the case itself, I would still recommend getting <a href="../../../../tech-talk/reviews/urban-armor-for-your-personal-assistant/index.html">a screen protector</a> for your device, to make the protection complete.</p>
<p>Proporta calls that case <em>&#8220;a way to protect your device from dust and scratches&#8221;</em> and after a week of putting my device in some dusty, though not dirty, places, I can vouch for this claim.</p>
<p><strong>Hot or not?</strong></p>
<p>Considering all, the Proporta XDA Flame Silicone case is a great product. For $20, <a href="http://proporta.com/F02/PPF02P05.php?t_id=3537&#038;t_mode=des">this product</a> will protect your device from (soft) impacts and scratches. You will end up with a Pocket PC that, in essence, still looks the same and has the same usability as before, only that now it is protected in a stylish silicone case.</p>

		<h2 id="post-118"><a href="../../12/three-great-songs-you-should-listen-to/index.html" rel="bookmark">Three great songs you should listen to</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 12th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Every once in a while, I come across a great song that just kicks in the way many songs do not.</p>
<p>First up is <em>These Arms</em> from Matt Costa. I heard this song in the second season finale from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unit">The Unit</a>, a TV show that combines drama and action the right way, even better than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAG">JAG</a> managed to do.</p>
<p>The song stuck with me, mostly because of the scenes that it was used in during the season finale, and if you have seen it and look at <a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/matt-costa-these-arms-lyrics.html">the lyrics</a>, you will know why.</p>
<p>The song is available on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=zkPOYhRd-eQ">YouTube</a> with great audio quality. Disregard the video though, since that is not part of Costa&#8217;s masterpiece but rather a collection of clips from Veronica Mars.</p>
<p>Second spot goes to Mo&#8217;Jones&#8217; <em>Runnin&#8217; Blind for you</em>. Although the musical style is different to many of the other artists I enjoy, this easy going song really makes me smile. Not just because of the story that is told, but also because the whole idea of the song is so true for many people; we often let good chances pass by without making a (our) move.</p>
<p>Lyrics are available at the <a href="http://www.mojones.nl/songs/runnin.html">official site</a> and the original clip is up on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=c7vXYSKw1wU">YouTube</a>, go watch.</p>
<p>Finally, there ain&#8217;t no reason you should be missing out on a song from Brett Dennen, called <em>Ain&#8217;t No Reason</em> (yes, yes, cheap pun, I know).</p>
<p>Like <em>These Arms</em>, I first discovered this song in an episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unit">The Unit</a>, again, with a very fitting scene. It appears that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Dennen">Dennen</a> also saw some airplay in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy">Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</a>, which makes him even cooler.</p>
<p>Again, a deep and meaningful song with very <a href="http://www.sweetslyrics.com/309497.Brett%20Dennen%20-%20Ain't%20No%20Reason.html">interesting lyrics</a>. I found a good quality version of the song on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=zA2Se20IWKU">YouTube</a> and while the clip links up with the military theme of <em>The Unit</em> it is not related to the TV show.</p>

		<h2 id="post-117"><a href="../../12/mini-review-la-fonera-and-la-fontenna/index.html" rel="bookmark">Mini Review: La Fonera+ and La Fontenna</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on August 12th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Like the original La Fonera, the La Fonera+ is very easy to install: unpack, plug in, link up. The first La Fonera included a CD for those that needed additional help, the La Fonera+ does not even need that anymore. Simplicity by design, very nice.</p>
<p>The looks are fairly similar, the main difference is that the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20202-2/IMG_3338.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[117]">La Fonera+</a> includes a professional looking logo on the top side, while the original version included a more, well, let me call it<em>outgoing</em> logo. The back side of the La Fonera+ also includes an additional Ethernet port, which means you can most probably get rid of the second router you have.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.fon.com/FonShop/shop/ShopController?view=product&#038;product=PRD-018">La Fonera+</a>, like its older brother, sends out two WiFi signals. One is the public signal that is your contribution to the <a href="http://www.fon.com/">FON community</a>, the other is your private signal that only you can access. All in all, for $50, this is a fairly solid router, based on the very efficient OpenWRT firmware.</p>
<p>While the signal of both the La Fonera and La Fonera+ are fairly strong, you can enhance the signal <em>a lot</em> by using the <a href="https://shop.fon.com/FonShop/shop/ShopController?view=product&#038;product=PRD-ANT01">La Fontenna</a>. For an additional $2 with either a La Fonera or La Fonera+, this is a real no-brainer. Not only because this way, you will be able to enjoy your WiFi in even the furthest reaches of your house, garden and even a couple of streets down the road, but also because the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20199-2/IMG_3330.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[117]">La Fontenna</a> is suited for <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20195-2/IMG_3328.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[117]">outdoor use</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="post-116"><a href="../../12/why-i-prefer-linkedin-over-facebook/index.html" rel="bookmark">Why I prefer LinkedIn over Facebook</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 12th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>While reading today&#8217;s news feeds, I came across this <em>very</em> interesting item on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/11/facebook-source-code-leaked/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We just received a tip that the source code for the Facebook main index page has been leaked and published on a blog called Facebook Secrets.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I am no PHP guru, the code looks legit, as far as I can tell and that really makes me wonder: If someone can get to the most treasured part of a web application, its sourcecode, how easy would it be for an attacker to grab all my, non public data from my profile? How easy would it be for people that should not have access to my data, to actually create a profile on me and spam me even more?</p>
<p>Everyone always hypes how great Facebook and the Facebook API is and while it is not yet clear if the API contributed to the breach or not, it could still have been a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Facebook then gave an official statement, <del datetime="2007-08-12T10:11:03+00:00">trying to blame a misconfiguration</del> <ins datetime="2007-08-12T10:11:03+00:00">stating that it was a misconfiguration</ins>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of Facebook’s source code was exposed to a small number of users due to a bug on a single server that was misconfigured and then fixed immediately. It was <strong>not a security breach</strong> and <em>did not compromise user data</em> in any way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Techcrunch&#8217; Nik Cubrilovic then stated that:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems that the cause was apache and mod_php sending back un-interpreted source code as opposed to output, due to either a server misconfiguration or high load</p></blockquote>
<p>High load? One would expect that, with a site like Facebook, the developers / company behind the whole application would take precautions so that there are no leaks like this.</p>
<p>Either way, this kind of breach is probably next to impossible with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>. Reason for that is, if you ask me, the fact that they do not give everyone access to their servers / services (by means of a, supposedly badly coded API) and even if they would, I am more than certain that LinkedIn would have appropriate resources so that no server could experience that kind of high load that triggers it to reveal sourcecode.</p>
<p>Virtual hat tip to <a href="http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2007/08/11/facebook-indexphp-source-code-leaked/">Elliot C. Back</a></p>
<p>[UPDATE]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blakeross.com/">Blake Ross</a> kindly <a href="../../../../blog/media/why-i-prefer-linkedin-over-facebook/index.html#comment-406">pointed out</a> that the way this post was written suggested that part of TechCrunch&#8217;s statement was actually the official Facebook statement. It is not and I stand, humbly corrected.</p>
<p>Misquoting aside, I am still not happy about the fact that Facebook suffers this kind of problem right amidst their <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/25/facebook-in-court-with-connectu-press-conference-at-3-pm-pst/">legal troubles</a> and it does make one wonder if this was a deliberate attempt or really, just a misconfiguration.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/guides/index.html" title="View all posts in Guides" rel="category tag">Guides</a> on August 10th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>There is little doubt about my love for <a href="http://www.stuffbak.com/">StuffBak&#8217;s</a> lost &#038; found service and I have <a href="../../../../tech-talk/reviews/get-your-stuffbak/index.html">written</a> about it on a couple of occassions.</p>
<p>Back in February, I wrote a guide about how to extend your <a href="../../../../tech-talk/guides/get-your-stuffbak-with-windows-vista/index.html">StuffBak protection</a> with a custom designed boot screen for Windows Vista. This time around, I&#8217;ll be discussing how you can protect your Windows Mobile (5) powered Pocket PC.</p>
<p>As with most customization guides available here, the standard disclaimer applies: I write about something that works for me. It may or may not work for you. If it works for you, feel free to post a comment with your device information, if it doesn&#8217;t work for you, retrace your steps and try to find a solution. If you manage to brick your device, don&#8217;t come screaming. I know it sucks but I can&#8217;t help you.</p>
<p>That said, let&#8217;s get down to the real stuff:</p>
<p>Pocket PCs tend to get smaller with every new revision and with more Pocket PCs being sold than ever before, its a fair assumption that a lot of important data is stored on these devices. To lose one of these devices is bad enough, but knowing that you didn&#8217;t do everything you could to help an honest finder to get it back is probably just as bad.</p>
<p>This guide will most probably consist of two parts, in this part, I&#8217;ll be discussing how to create a boot screen for your device, the next guide will focus on a way to create a theme that displays your StuffBak tag.</p>
<p>The first thing you need is a StuffBak tag, which, I assume that you already have. In case you do not have one, head on over to <a href="http://www.stuffbak.com/sb/">stuffbak.com</a> and grab yourself a set.</p>
<p>Take a note of the code of your tag and grab yourself <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/kerimsatirli/tech-talk/guides/stuffbak-bootscreen/stuffbak_windowsmobile_bootscreen.psd.html">this PSD</a> file from my gallery. You can edit it in Adobe Photoshop and many other image manipulation applications.</p>
<p>Pick the text tool and edit the text field. You will want to input your own StuffBak tag there.</p>
<p>The next step is to save the image. The name you will want to use is <em>&#8220;welcomehead.96.png&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>The next to last step involves connecting your device to your PC, make sure that Windows Mobile Device Center (or ActiveSync) starts and copying the <em>&#8220;welcomehead.96.png&#8221;</em> to your device.</p>
<p>Finally, use Pocket Explorer, <a href="http://www.ghisler.com/ce.htm">Total Commander CE</a> or any other mobile file explorer of your choice to copy the file to your <em>/Windows</em> directory.</p>
<p>Now, whenever you soft-reset your device, you will <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20175-1/stuffbak_windowsmobile_boot.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[115]">see your boot screen</a> with your very own StuffBak tag.</p>
<p>Note that this solution does not guarantee that your device will be returned to you, but at least you made it a lot easier for honest finders to get in touch with the rightful owner of the device.</p>
