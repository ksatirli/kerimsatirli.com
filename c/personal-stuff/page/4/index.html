		<p>Sometimes, people ask me why I devote time to blogging, after all, it is one of those pastimes you do not earn much â€˜cred with on the streets. Which, obviously is not entirely correct, but that is not the point.</p>
<p>The reason I do this is simple, I like to share my thoughts with the world, and occasionally, the world replies and tells me heartwarming things like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20170-1/the_reason_i_do_this.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[111]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20172-2/the_reason_i_do_this.png" alt="The reason I do this" /></a></p>
<p>If this is not one of the best reasons to do this, then I would not know what is. Thanks, Josh.</p>

		<p>I just finished reading a book called &#8220;Mijn Leven met Tikker&#8221; (Living with Tikker), a very interesting story about trust, bonding, love, respect and the pain that eventually follows all of this. I&#8217;ve been a dog owner for 14 years, until my dog died during the winter of 2004 and at times, Tikker&#8217;s story feels like the story of my own dog, Timmy.</p>
<p>The author, who was the actual owner of the dog, shares his impressions about living with a canine. The book talks about how hard it can be to teach a dog to do certain things but also goes into detail about how rewarding it is to face the challenge about raising a non-human being. The story goes on to talk about eventually illnesses many dogs acquire in the last years of their lives and how this dog had to cope with it. Some scenes are described in such vivid detail that I actually had the feeling that I was standing right there with the dog and his handler and experiencing the whole thing first-hand.</p>
<p>Humans often think that canines are incapable of showing high-level emotions but in fact, canines are very capable of displaying their mood. My dog, like Tikker, became self-conscious when he discovered that he couldn&#8217;t do certain things anymore, he didn&#8217;t want me to see how weak he had become, probably even began to question if I till loved him.</p>
<p>That, simply, is how dogs are, most of them will stick by you for the duration of their life, if you let them. If you manhandle them, they will hold a grudge for some time, but eventually give you another chance, at least, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been hearing. Can&#8217;t imagine manhandling my dog (or any other benign for that matter).</p>
<p>All in all, the book is very interesting and if you are able to read Dutch, I&#8217;d highly recommend reading this book. It&#8217;s a very interesting story and if you ever had a dog, you will most certainly be able to understand the hardships the author had to and has to endure, now that his dog is gone.</p>

		<h2 id="post-75"><a href="../../../../2007/03/07/distorted-perception/index.html" rel="bookmark">distorted perception</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../blog/college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on March 7th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>People are being influenced by their surroundings. In order to not alienate yourself from the people that you love, you&#8217;ll most probably try to fit in. Sure, some try harder than others, but all do try. That is my opinion anyway.</p>
<p>Most of the times, the better you fit in in your surroundings, the more success you will achieve, sometimes though, your environment can be damaging to you, your health or your future.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this yesterday and started analyzing the comments I received from various people in my life, people who know me or like to think that they know me. Some of them, in my opinion, are more qualified than others to &#8220;judge&#8221; me, some are entirely unfit to comment on anything.</p>
<p>About a year ago, someone I was spending a lot of time with at the time, claimed that I&#8217;m way too childish for my age. She deemed my behavior inappropriate and basically recommended me to &#8220;grow up a little&#8221;.</p>
<p>Naturally, after being with someone for three years, those claims aren&#8217;t just thoughts that were spat out in a heated discussion, but are something that managed to manifest itself over time.</p>
<p>Then, a few months later, when college began again, I had my second meeting with the mentor that was assigned to me. Her thoughts about me collided totally with what I&#8217;ve been told earlier. She thought of me as &#8220;way too business-focussed&#8221;, bordering the &#8220;uptight&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny when you think about it. A person you&#8217;ve known for about three hours at the time (that is, two meetings of 90 minutes each) thinks she is qualified to judge you and your actions.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that her opinion should be dismissed, after all, she may or may not have studied psychology and thus may very well be capable of evaluating a student&#8217;s actions and provide feedback based upon that.</p>
<p>On the other hand though, you have to understand where people are coming from. The first person had a personal interest in the issue. She would benefit if I&#8217;d change. The second person, according to my opinion, just tried to force her views on me. She wouldn&#8217;t gain anything if I&#8217;d become less &#8220;uptight&#8221;, other than personal gratification.</p>
<p>The other day, I was talking to two other people. The first one, a person I&#8217;ve been working with for 18 months now, called me a &#8220;friggin&#8217; rockstar&#8221; and outlined how he deemed my mindset totally appropriate for the things I am trying to achieve.</p>
<p>He also shared some personal experience with me about how people in his (professional) environment told him to slow down, be less uptight and relax more. In his opinion, those that lack focus will always try to slow you down, not for your own best will, but because they perceive you as a threat. According to him, if you would slow down, it would give those people a chance to catch up with you, on a professional level and you&#8217;d be less competitive.</p>
<p>The way I see it, I have to strongly agree with his assessment. I know that I&#8217;m focussed and can be too focussed in times when said focus is needed. That however, doesn&#8217;t mean that I lack perspective. Most of all the actions I have taken in the last years are geared towards one objective: finishing college and gaining a skill set that will make me competitive on the market I am going to work on.</p>
<p>I see students in my college who are, technically speaking, able to achieve a lot, maybe more than me, but they don&#8217;t try to. Some of them just don&#8217;t care about being successful, some of them just lack the needed focus.</p>
<p>In essence, it comes down to the following: If people in your environment tell you to slow down, take where they are coming from into consideration. Don&#8217;t just do it because you value them, think about yourself first.</p>
<p>They may be able to distort your perception, but as long as you enable yourself to put some perspective to it, you should be able to distinguish those that are telling you to slow down so they can gain an advantage on you and those who are genuinely worried about you and your workload.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>The other day, a friend of mine asked me how I could find time to blog in my busy schedule. After all, good content takes time to create and I&#8217;m blogging in a non-native language too, so, according to him, I would have to spend even more time on creating an entry than normal bloggers do.</p>
<p>The way I come up with posts is rather unorthodox. When I go to bed, after reading the last news of the day, I&#8217;ll start reminiscing on the events of the day and the past week. After finding something that interests me, I&#8217;d grab my phone and jot down a few quick thoughts and finally go to sleep.</p>
<p>The inspiration I get for writing entries isn&#8217;t really limited to personal stuff though. Sometimes it&#8217;s a project at college that I&#8217;ve been working on and sometimes it&#8217;s something I read somewhere that I have a strong opinion about that I want to share with others.</p>
<p>The next morning then, I&#8217;d grab my notes while commuting and think them through again, sometimes you come up with great ideas before going to bed and at other times you just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Not all of the notes I jot down are really worthy to write about and if they are not, I&#8217;ll just have to wait for another rush of inspiration to come my way. However, if I deem a set of notes interesting, I&#8217;d start writing more about it&#8230;</p>
<p>There have been occasions when I started writing and midway through, I&#8217;d come up with another possible entry, not necessarily related to the current one, and jot that one down too.</p>
<p>All in all, I just utilize the time that is available to me in the best way possible, I guess.</p>

		<h2 id="post-72"><a href="../../../../2007/02/25/the-pursuit-of-happyness/index.html" rel="bookmark">The Pursuit of Happyness</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a>, <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on February 25th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>I just came back from spending some quality time with a good friend of mine and I somehow had the urge to blog about tonight. We went to see &#8220;<a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thepursuitofhappyness/">The Pursuit of Happyness</a>&#8220;, a reflection on the life of Christopher Gardner, the guy who didn&#8217;t just live the American dream, no, he rewrote it.</p>
<p>The movie tells the story of the struggle and difficulties Gardner, who is portrayed by Will Smith, has to overcome in order to succeed. I must admit, the beginning of the movie was rather &#8230; shall we say, uninteresting, it was strange to see Will Smith use bad language, &#8217;cause he barely ever does that and while I&#8217;m able to handle bad language, it didn&#8217;t seem fitting.</p>
<p>After half an hour though, the story had gotten to me. Smith is a great actor and he has portrayed some great characters, but this one, was, hands down, the best thing I&#8217;ve ever seen him do. Now, I&#8217;m no big shot movie critic but this movie has all it needs:</p>
<p>Smith and his (real life) son are portrayed in a great array of situations, you can see them having fun together and you can literally read Gardner&#8217;s mind, the thoughts that are crossing through it, the problems and challenges he is facing. It&#8217;s surreal.</p>
<p>The movie makes you feel bad, just looking at those pictures, the fight Smith has to put up to with in order to reach his final goal, to succeed in getting a job at Dean Witter Reynolds, a stock brokerage firm. The ordeals Gardner went through are &#8230; amazing.</p>
<p>Now, the movie portrays the whole internship thing as an unpaid training, while Gardner actually received $1,000 and there are some other things that aren&#8217;t told in the same way it happened back in 1981, but still, this movie touched me on a level that no movie ever did until now.</p>
<p>I may not have faced the hardships that Chris Gardner has faced and I may never face them, but his story and most of all, the way he solved the problems he was thrown at inspires me. Gardner doesn&#8217;t know the concept of &#8220;giving up&#8221; and for what it&#8217;s worth, he is a better man for that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to spend a few bucks on a great story, I can more than recommend checking out this movie. No matter if you watch it on a DVD, in a cinema or just grab the <a href="http://fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook38506.htm">book</a>, the story will get to you.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, this year might only be a couple of weeks old, but I have found my favorite movie of the year already.</p>
