		<description>Jimmy,

it is difficult around the world to get people to actually return your device, no matter if it is a PDA, simple phone or anything.

I would like to believe that everyone would just do the right thing and be honest about returning stuff they find, but many people are not.

Still, for those that are honest enough, I am more than willing to provide ample opportunity.

That said, a software solution would add another layer of protection to my device. I might have to look into that.</description>

		<description>I am not a pda user myself but came across the software from handago and google for more information which was how I found your site too.

From the country, malaysia i come from it be tough to get someone to proactively return the phone for sure but then of course the issue is more environmentally too.</description>

		<description>Jimmy,

for the sake of keeping the conversation going, I will assume that you are not affiliated with Bak2U even though the way you asked the question sounds a little bit funny.

That said, I believe in a multi-layered concept. I'd rather have two, three or even four solutions available for an honest finder. StuffBak believes in a concept where users are willing to return your device.

The software from bak2u is a different solution where honest finders are not required to do anything and the software takes over, which can be useful too.</description>

		<description>Won't it be better if just install the anti-theft software from bak2u.com to protect the windows mobile?</description>
