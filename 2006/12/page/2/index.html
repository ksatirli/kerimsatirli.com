	<div class="main">
		<p>Twenty years ago when people referenced their friends, they generally talked about people they knew for a very long time. Relationships lasted long, friendships lasted even longer. Basically, most friends you made back then were going to stick around till the bitter end and you’d meet up with them on various occasions.</p>
<p>I’m no researcher, but I think that the above concept of relationships and friendships is outdated. Don’t get me wrong, I value people who stick around for a long time, stand by you during the good and the bad times and help you overcome obstacles, but I personally don’t see it happening for many people I know.</p>
<p>Let me elaborate, during the last decades, our mobility increased by 500%, going shopping in London in the weekend (no matter where you live) is easily accomplished. Participating in a relationship with someone who’s living some 2,000 miles away is doable. Making acquaintances all over the globe and meeting them at some point is daily life for some people.</p>
<p>With all the added mobility however, comes another feat: priority and prioritizing. Many people have various levels of friendship – there are the close friends, the very close friends, the good friends, the normal friends, the friends –friends, the yeah-I-heard-his-name-kind-of-guys (and gals). Two decades ago you had best friends, friends and people you knew. Now, with all these added layers, people are prioritizing, some on a conscious level, most on a subconscious level.</p>
<p>Friends are like information in today’s world. Everyone has a story to tell, everyone has one quirk or another and we have to remember each and every one of them, or at least a great deal. One might note all this information in a notebook, another might use digital technology to track the attributes of their friends and someone else might just remember most stuff. Either way, people have to cope with loads of extra information that wasn’t available (because of the lack of different layers) twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s important to remember many attributes of your friends; after all, that is what partially makes you a good friend. Supporting each other, no matter if romance is involved or not is still as important as it was two decades ago, but today you have a lot more choices. Do you want to talk to your best friend or your partner? To which one are you going to talk to? The one you are romantically involved with or the one you’ve been dating a year ago?</p>
<p>Added layers mean lower intensity. At least, they do for me. I have a certain amount of time I’m willing and am able to spend on friends every day, week, month and the more friends you have, the more you need to spread that time out in a fair way. If you have loads of friends, you’re probably not spending half as much time as you should (and would like to) with them, if you have few friends, you can focus a lot more on the individual, but you lack the added information; information that can be turned into knowledge to improve yourself, your character or your creations, in the most broad sense possible.</p>
<p>All in all, I personally experience micro relationships as very positive. I believe that these relationships are a lot more flexible and they don’t have a clearly defined beginning (or end). You meet ad-hoc, whenever it suits both persons, you have fewer expectations to meet, yet you can still contribute a lot to such friendship, it’s all up to you.</p>
<p>Naturally the concept of micro relationships doesn&#8217;t apply to people in a marriage, but then again, some might argue that marriages are a form of the past too &#8230;</p>
<p>I wonder what others are thinking - feel free to contribute.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../../c/blog/projects/index.html" title="View all posts in Projects" rel="category tag">Projects</a> on December 11th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been working on a <a href="http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/">Battlefield 2</a> based movie. Machinima movies always intrigued me and I wanted to shoot a film in 2006 anyway, so I thought that I might as well combine those two.</p>
<p>During the summer months, I started writing a story about the war some soldiers have to fight during the actual war. Since the movie is based on Battlefield 2, we&#8217;ll have loads of American and Middle Eastern actors and I&#8217;m doing my best to create micro stories around each and every important character. Granted, only five or six of them really are important, but you&#8217;ll probably know a lot more about them by the end of the movie.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not willing to break the story yet, but I wanted to talk about something relating to this movie:</p>
<p>During my first year in <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a>, we spent two weeks in a short-term project called &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221;. The idea behind said project is that the only thing your tutor gives you is a word, no idea, no limits, just a word. Ours was &#8220;waiting room&#8221; and during the two weeks the project lasted, we (a small group of four students) came up with a less than greatly executed solution. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the idea we had really had (and has) potential, but the way we executed it just wasn&#8217;t up to par.</p>
<p>Those two weeks were really the only time during that year I regretted, I didn&#8217;t learn anything (new) and we (all) created tension that, for a certain part, still lingers around and influences current decisions, nine months after &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221; concluded.</p>
<p>This year, I wanted to do something different, I wanted to do something productive and expand my knowledge. Normally, &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221; in the second year links up with a very short internship (of ten working days) at a company that will probably help you make a final decision as to which profile you&#8217;re going to choose for the last two years of your college career. I was really looking forward to that internship and even got in touch with a print shop, because, well, printing stuff, the right way, is something I&#8217;m interested in.</p>
<p>Long story short, we were supposed to have some sort of orientational period this year but it won&#8217;t be an internship - a pity, if you ask me. Then again, I already know what I&#8217;m going to do next year and I don&#8217;t want to waste another two weeks, just to regret them two months from now (FreeSpace is coming up at the end of January 2007).</p>
<p>So, not wanting to waste another two weeks of my short time in college, I decided to put in some work and talk to the man. I <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/lifeofacoder/its-about-how-you-sell-it/bf2_movie_project_pitch_20061211_02_enUS.pdf.html">pitched my idea</a> for the movie in the most business-like way I could imagine and guess what? It worked.</p>
<p>Turns out, the people I pitched my idea to where sold after about the first minute, out of the ten minutes I talked. Apparently, it&#8217;s just about how you sell it and if you do it the right way, your college will even give you permission to play a game and earn some credits with it.</p>
<p>(Naturally, I&#8217;m not just playing a game, I&#8217;m actually writing a scenario, drawing up story boards, locating suitable actors and supporting actors, dabble with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition/">Adobe Audition</a> to clean up the audio, work with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/nl/products/premiere/">Adobe Premiere</a> to cut and edit, use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/">Adobe After Effects</a> to create flashy effects and finalize the whole thing in Flash Video with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/">Adobe Flash</a>.)</p>

		<h2 id="post-40"><a href="../../06/way-to-do-guerilla-marketing/index.html" rel="bookmark">Way to do Guerilla Marketing!</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/media/marketing/index.html" title="View all posts in Marketing" rel="category tag">Marketing</a> on December 6th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Back at the <a href="http://www.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web</a> conference, I was first presented with a product called &#8220;<a href="http://www.fleck.com/">Fleck</a>&#8220;, basically a web 2.0 post-it service. Now, since this probably doesn&#8217;t make much sense to most people, I&#8217;d suggest clicking on <a href="http://extension.fleck.com/?sh=58d4e5e7fe7a264e00ff8e4203d070961bf2bc67">this link</a> and experiencing the goodness that is Fleck for yourself.</p>
<p>Fleck is a project by Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten, Patrick de Laive and Arjen Schat - if you don&#8217;t know those names, you don&#8217;t know your internet history very well, I guess. These three guys, like they&#8217;ve done so many times before, came up with the whole idea and coded it from the ground up and made sure it was ready to rock when they released it into the wild.</p>
<p>Being a privately funded company, means, to me at least, that there aren&#8217;t loads of resources for extensive marketing so the Fleck team came up with something unique, something perfectly suited for their service:</p>
<p>Fleck&#8217;ians invaded <a href="http://www.brightlive.nl/">BRIGHTLive</a> and Fleck&#8217;ed <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/brightlive_06/brightlive_kay/IMG_1835.JPG.html">just</a> about <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/brightlive_06/brightlive_kay/IMG_1834.JPG.html">anything</a> they <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/brightlive_06/brightlive_kay/IMG_1845.JPG.html">saw</a>.</p>
<p>Total cost of this gig is probably around EUR 20, if not less. Total exposure is probably worth 20 times as much. Great job guys, that&#8217;s the way to do guerilla marketing!</p>

		<h2 id="post-39"><a href="../../04/brightlive-recap/index.html" rel="bookmark">BRIGHTLive - recap</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on December 4th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Three days ago, I attended BRIGHTLive with some friends of mine and considering the price we paid, we certainly got our money&#8217;s worth. The whole venue was a lot more commercial than I&#8217;d have liked it to be, but that&#8217;s to be expected really. It&#8217;s the same for CeBIT and other, similar events.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll cut the guys from BRIGHT some slack though, since this was the first incarnation and I&#8217;m quite certain that the next BRIGHTLives will be a lot bigger.</p>
<p>When I first read <a href="http://www.bright.nl/">BRIGHT</a>, at the Web 2.0 conference &#8220;<a href="http://www.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web</a>&#8220;, I was immediately sold. The content of this mag links up nicely with my topics of interest and it&#8217;s generally stuff that isn&#8217;t available 6 weeks up front via the internet (to be honest, it probably is, but I&#8217;m too lazy to spend time on looking for it).</p>
<p>So, back then, I signed up for a trial of three issues and read thru the day I received each one; I wanted to prolong my subscription, but decided to wait a little bit, till after BRIGHTLive, to see if they&#8217;d come up with a really good reason.</p>
<p>Turns out I don&#8217;t have to wait that long: I managed to talk Dion, a BRIGHTLive staffer, into handing me over one of the official BRIGHTLive tee&#8217;s for nada. In return, I signed up for another three issues of their mag. Quite the win-win situation for both of us, especially considering that the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/brightlive_06/brightlive_kay/IMG_1896.JPG.html">official price</a> for those tees was EUR 25. Thanks Dion!</p>
<p>All in all, BRIGHTLive was certainly worth the time, especially if you consider that we got to see an improv-performance from <a href="http://www.boomchicago.nl/">BOOM Chicago</a> new show &#8220;Me, MySpace and iPod&#8221;. I even managed to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhxdPzCmaVc">record one of their songs</a>, albeit the visual result turned out quite bad. Turns out that BOOM Chicago isn&#8217;t for everyone. While I loved their show and couldn&#8217;t stop laughing, the other guys attending the show didn&#8217;t appreciate it as much.</p>
<p>Naturally, I&#8217;ve uploaded a &#8220;few&#8221; shots from BRIGHTLive to my <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/brightlive_06/">gallery</a> too. Enjoy.</p>
