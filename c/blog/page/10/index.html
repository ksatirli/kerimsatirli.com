		<p>As part of my Bachelor&#8217;s Degree, I am currently doing an internship at <a href="http://media.xolo.tv">xolo.tv</a>, a company that focuses on a number of things that revolve around social media, video production and media sharing.</p>
<p>While the biggest part of my internship consists of actually interning and learning new things, a small part of the whole experience (and a rather big part of the grade) is related to keeping a journal that is accessible to anyone who is interested.</p>
<p>Considering that I am very proud of being able to intern at <em>xolo.tv</em> and at the same time too lazy to set up a new blog, just for the purpose of writing weekly reports, I figured that I might as well post my reports <a href="../../college/internships/index.html">here</a>.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on January 19th, 2008 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>The second (and last) day of Video Vortex kicked off with a promising presentation, given by <a href="http://home.hum.uva.nl/oz/elsaesser/">Thomas Elsaesser</a> on the narrativity in cinema and video in general.</p>
<p>Mr. Elsaesser used the <a href="http://youtube.com/v/SlMhFOwozoQ" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Honda Cog">Honda Cog</a> ad, which worked very well with the crowd, especially since he also showed the &#8220;spin offs&#8221; of the actual ad.</p>
<p>Elsaesser concluded his speech by saying that:</p>
<blockquote><p>YouTube can be addictive as it drags you along, but after two or three hours, a sense of entropy sets in and the joy of discovering the unexpected wears of</p></blockquote>
<p>Powerful words, no doubt about it. All in all, his presentation is difficult to summarize in a few words, but definitely the kind of talk I was hoping to hear during the conference.</p>
<p>Next up was <a href="http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.a.a.simons/">Jan Simons</a> who talked about the effects of tagging (especially in the sense of Flickr) on a system as a whole.</p>
<p>According to Simons, tagging creates messy categories, which is of course true, especially considering that many things have more than one meaning (homonymy), such as &#8220;rock&#8221; in a musical sense and &#8220;rock&#8221; in a geological sense and then there are things that have more than one name (synonymy), such as the season known as fall and autumn.</p>
<p>It basically comes down to the fact that tags cannot be trusted when trying to categorize content, because, and I will use another example from Simons here, a tag such as &#8220;in England&#8221; might mean that one, a picture was <em>made in England</em>, or two, a picture could reflect the life <em>in England</em>.</p>
<p>The speech was concluded with an example of massive tag overuse, which can be found <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/robertinobobo/2191593599/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The third speaker of the morning panel, <a href="http://www.croartgallery.com/biography.asp?id=89">Dan Oki</a> talked about space and the importance of space in video as well as how, for example, the <a href="http://www.blairwitch.com/">Blair Witch Project</a> was important for the evolution of cinematography.</p>
<p>After a quick lunch, the afternoon sessions were set to start, but a Jane Doe (Gabriele something) took the stage to talk about a project of hers called &#8220;GaMa&#8221;, which tries to be a gateway to archives of media art.</p>
<p>A quick search reveals that they already received 1.8 million US Dollars in funding from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/econtentplus/projects/funded_projects/index_en.htm">European Union</a> nearly two years ago, yet the Jane Doe, initiator of the project, just explained that they are still trying to figure out their business model. It does make one wonder how the European Union decides who to fund and who not to fund &#8230;</p>
<p>After a quick intermission, the actual panel, with a focus on <a href="http://www.networkcultures.org/videovortex/programme/program/#curating">curating online video</a> was kicked off by Sarah Cook</p>
<p>Patrick Lichty, professor of Interactive Art and Media Theory at the Columbia College in Chicago shared his thoughts about online video in relation to context, tradition and audience.</p>
<p>Nothing really ground-breaking there other than a couple of, to me, obvious reasons why artists have not yet embraced YouTube and probably never will, unless YouTube changes the way they treat their contributing members.</p>
<p>Lichty&#8217;s conclusion quickly referenced LOLCats and that, somehow, made the whole thing go <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/european-bloggers-conference-thursday-recap/index.html">full circle</a>.</p>
<p>After another quick break, Tilman Baumgärtel started the final panel of the conference, Participatory Culture.</p>
<p>Pirated media in Asias was the main topic of Baumgärtel&#8217;s talk, he explained how piracy in Asia is different to Europe, because of the lack of availability of high-speed Internet access in rural areas and also because of the lack of trust.</p>
<p>Whereas in Europe and the Americas, downloads are the primary form of piracy, Asians prefer physical stuff such as CDs and DVDs.</p>
<p>The speaker also talked about a movie called Ciplak, an ultra-low-budget production that was filmed over the span of a month, with a Canon XM2 Mini DV cam and equipment such as Ikea lamps.</p>
<p>The movie, however, looks great and I would recommend anyone interested in indi-media (or Asian movies) to check it out - we were treated to a few minutes of it and all had a good laugh.</p>
<p>At one point, Baumgärtel talked about how some film makers use pirates as a(nother) selling channel: pirates are seeded with a semi-good quality version of the film and after enough momentum has been established, the director releases a DVD with a high-resolution version of the movie and to make it even more interesting, also includes games, screensavers and a making off. While it does sound a tad crazy to most Europeans, I can see how this kind of marketing would work in a market that primarily relies on piracy.</p>
<p>It would appear that the whole <em>piracy thing</em> is a very strict business. For every one master copy of a new movie that enters the country, three copies are made and distributed, within 24 hours or less, to the different islands. Only then does local reproduction of a pirated movie actually start and even then, the production only happens during the day. The reason for that is simply that the pressing plants generate more noise than most neighbors would accept during the night and with the police breathing down the necks of pirates, giving &#8220;the man&#8221; another reason to lock you up might not seem the smartest move.</p>
<p>More information on Baumgärtel&#8217;s talk and works can be found on <a href="http://www.asian-edition.org">asian-edition.org</a>, a name that spans from the time where the government of an Asian nation issued a decree that allowed the local populace to copy and distribute European and American books and other publications.</p>
<p>Ana Percaica&#8217;s topic was &#8220;Avi and Divx Art&#8221; and brushes topics such as the copyright laws in Croatia and the destruction and confiscation of videotheque copies in the early Nineties.</p>
<p>She talked about how, for example, a home-made porn video of a local celebrity gained so much exposure that we number of downloads came very close to the number of total inhabitants of Croatia and did a good job at explaining why the whole concept of &#8220;copyright&#8221; does not work all that well in Croatia.</p>
<p>Severina, the porn-lady, was also the underlying topic of the whole talk; it would appear that, in order to protect her innocence (uhuh), Severina apparently asked for all downloaded copies back (yes, the audience chuckled on that note), a clear indicator that the concept of downloads is not as obvious as it would appear to be.</p>
<p>Severina even instructed her lawyer to force the portal that distributed the clip to remove it, but could only support her claim by stating that the video invaded her privacy - which it did not, since she was the one that leaked it initially and her follow-up attempt, claiming that it was &#8220;video art&#8221;, was also dismissed, based on the grounds of the fact that home-made porn is not art, because it simply is not innovative. Maybe you should have gone for the whipped cream and honey after all, Severina?</p>
<p>The last speech of the day was given by Dominic Chen, who works with <a href="http://www.creativecommons.jp/">Creative Commons Japan</a>.<br />
Of all the speeches that were given during the whole conference, I would have to say that his was the best.</p>
<p>His topic, the critical point of the commons and digital prochronism (yes, it <em>is</em> a mouthful) was both interesting and innovative.</p>
<p>Chen presented on the explosive grow of content and the need for a meta-platform that would be able to handle the growth, he touched on subjects such as the <em>war for openess</em> between Google on Facebook and spiced up his talk with interesting images and video clips as well as clean presentation slides.</p>
<p>All in all, Chen shared some great notes and thoughts with us and really knew how to handle the, seemingly difficult audience.</p>
<p>As always, once Chen&#8217;s speech got interesting, the producers told the speaker to wrap it up and call it a day. A quick recap was given and the bar opened.</p>
<p>The first Video Vortex in Amsterdam, to me, was a moderate success. The second day was much better than the first one, mostly because the speakers were more interesting to me and talked about stuff I actually could relate to. Nonetheless, it was a welcome change of the</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on January 19th, 2008 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>After a rather mediocre conference day at <a href="http://kerimsatirli.com/blog/media/events/video-vortex-conference-friday-recap/">Video Vortex</a>, I finally got a shot at meeting some other Dutch <em>Last.fm&#8217;ers</em> during the first (of hopefully many) Dutch Last.fm Live Meeting.</p>
<p>Now, for those that do not know <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> let me give you a quick overview: last.fm is a kind of social network that tracks what you are listening to. It is a great way of showing of your taste (or lack thereof), but also works nicely as a way to discover new music through friends and Last.fm&#8217;s music matching features.</p>
<p>Set-up by <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/stephanstegeman/">Stephan</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/wafel9/">Walter</a>, two other <a href="http://www.xolo.tv/">xolo.tv</a> colleagues of mine, it is safe to say that, even though we were a tad on the light side as far as attendance goes, with ten of <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/Nederlandse+Last.fm+live+meeting+groep">70 members</a> showing up, we all had a great time and <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/nederlandse_lastfm_live_meeting_0108/">we even have proof</a> for it!</p>
<p>All in all, a great evening and definitely something I will be back for next time.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on January 16th, 2008 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Yesterday marked the conclusion of our most recent project, the current batch of juniors at <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">CMD Breda</a> have now officially concluded the bigger part of their study and can now move on to internships, minors and other awesome stuff.</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the conclusion of nine weeks of hard work and lots of annoyances for just about everyone even remotely involved with our group.</p>
<p>As always, our group consisted of students representing the four different majors our faculty offers and that is where the problems began: traditionally speaking, a faculty like ours always attracts more media designers than technologists, there are generally more interface designers than marketeers / project planners and with projects that rely heavily on the technical side of things and good branding, this, eventually leads to problems.</p>
<p>It is said that the first few meetings of any group are essential. Think of two dogs that meet for the first time - they will sniff each other out, try to gain as much information about the other as they can and then move on. During the next meeting, they will have some sort of idea of what to expect and based on that will either take a friendly or hostile stance towards the other.</p>
<p>This is the very spot where it went wrong for our group. Our first meeting ended in a situation where no one was willing to be the team leader and I can understand that; after all, leading a group of five is no easy job, let alone a group of 32 other students, but in the end, if your major includes the very classes needed to lead a team, namely project management, team building and all, you should at least be capable of taking the helming and steering the group towards a mediocre final product.</p>
<p>Now, do not get me wrong, I am not bitter or harbor any hard feelings, not in the least, but I feel that there is a great number of things that could have, that <em>should</em> have been done better.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with this project is that we worked in teams of 33 people where everyone seemed to have the same voting rights. Democracy is fine and all that, but as long as everyone can veto many things, the outcome of a project will be uncertain.</p>
<p>I believe that, if the project were to have internal representatives that would be allowed to vote (and represent a group of say five or six people) and that those votes were to be considered final, that we would have gotten through the planning / brainstorming stage a lot faster.</p>
<p>Another pet peeve of mine is that our group had little to no regard for application development protocols. I do, of course, realize that with things like this, last-minute changes are part of the whole deal and I would not mind those changes if they were only to fix a bug or two, but if those changes include building new features, days after a feature-freeze has been issued, I get annoyed.</p>
<p>I get even more annoyed when the building of those features results in bugs that kill other, more essential functionality of the main application due to a lack of testing (which was my fault however).</p>
<p>I am a technologist at heart, I suck at designing and I know that, but I try to make up for that lack by knowing just about everything there is to know about the project at hand and I dislike it when people tell me to do things differently when I know that that my solution is going to be used in the end.</p>
<p>One such situation occurred with the building of one of our sub-sites; back in November, I suggested that we include a member registration system, because it would not make sense for everyone to be able to upload data to the site, but I was veto&#8217;ed against. A couple of weeks later, all of a sudden, the request for a member system came in and I had to realize it, long story short: I believe that I understood the way the whole thing would have to be set-up a lot better than those that actually envisioned it.</p>
<p>After weeks of work, much of it being redundant, as in: building features, removing them and rebuilding them, we finally entered the home stretch and with only a couple of days to go, I was confident that we would be able to pull it off (we did!), yet, for one reason or another, it had to be a lot more difficult than it should have been:</p>
<p>Everyone who has ever worked with a live audio / video feed knows that a script is an <em>absolute must</em>, not because I have a hard time remembering things (I do), but because it is essential for everyone involved to know when something is going to happen and how long it is going to last.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the team involved with the live feed begged for a script, yet we did not receive one. Due to the shuffling of the various clips, we could not make our own, yet the team lead had the audacity to complain about the clips not being played out perfectly in the dry-run.</p>
<p>These things simply annoy me to no end and I am happy, very happy that we are finally done with it. I have learned a lot in the past nine weeks: a bit about streaming with the Flash Media Server and the Darwin Server and a whole lot about team dynamics and how the lack thereof can make everything exponentially worse.</p>

<p>For one reason or another, many of this year&#8217;s top song come from TV shows such as Jericho (more on that later) and The Unit and it comes as no surprise then that the <a href="../../../../blog/media/three-great-songs-you-should-listen-to/index.html">previously mentioned</a> &#8220;Ain&#8217;t no reason&#8221; by Brett Dennen gets the award for best &#8220;standalone song from 2007&#8243; from me.</p>
<p>Meaningful lyrics that tell things like they are, not like people want them to be and the song that was used for my impromptu-inauguration at <a href="http://media.xolo.tv/">xolo.tv</a>, this was the one song I could not stop listening to in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Room Eleven - Six White Russians and a Pink Pussycat</strong></p>
<p>The band that made the most impact on me was, without a doubt, <a href="http://www.roomeleven.nl/">Room Eleven</a> with their awesome album &#8220;Six White Russians and a Pink Pussycat&#8221;. Their <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/room-eleven-in-concert/index.html">live performance</a> was not just okay or good, it was <em>great</em>.</p>
<p>Songs such as <a href="http://youtube.com/v/5xa4T6u_UiI" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Room Eleven: One of these days">One of these Days</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/v/DwE0AkSVP48" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Room Eleven: Flavour"><br />
Flavour</a> and Come Closer are what music should be about: a great voice combined with great tunes.</p>
<p><strong>Jericho and Portal</strong></p>
<p>Other items that deserve to be mentioned are <a href="http://youtube.com/v/RthZgszykLs" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Portal: Still alive">Portal&#8217;s Still Alive</a> - the credits song from VALVe&#8217;s puzzle game released in fall this year.</p>
<p>A definite thumbs-up goes out to Jericho&#8217;s music team, with hot tracks such as Foo Fighter&#8217;s <a href="http://youtube.com/v/WG294M_kYWM" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Foo Fighters: Times likeThese">Times like These</a> and Five for Fighting&#8217;s <a href="http://youtube.com/v/K-kpR32B-Uk" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Five for Fighting">World</a>.</p>
