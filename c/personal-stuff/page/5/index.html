		<p>I was just talking to a friend of mine who had an interesting experience:</p>
<p>She and a friend of hers were speeding along a quiet neighbourhood, when all of a sudden a police officer pulled them over. Now, first thing most people would do is panic, but these two people kept their cool and actually managed to have a nice chat with the officer. Long story short, he didn&#8217;t sign a ticket and, awkwardly, asked for the number of the girl.</p>
<p>Regardless if he got it or not, I was wondering what I&#8217;d do in a similar situation (albeit, with a female cop):</p>
<p>The officer just saved you $50 or more and all they ask for in return is your number because they find you attractive and maybe even interesting. Should you feel obliged to give it to them? If you would, is it because you feel obliged to, because said officer kept your records clean or is it because the officer commands respect and you wouldn&#8217;t dare oppose someone in such a function? Would you give them your details based on a purely social evaluation, not taking the officer&#8217;s job into consideration?</p>
<p>Now, what would happen if the situation was slightly altered: replace the cop with a soldier, would you still feel that the job commands the same respect as a police officer does? Does a soldier command more respect? What about a firefighter, a (commercial) pilot?</p>
<p>If you give them your details, would you go for something highly <em>associatable</em>, like your land line number, something you could easily get rid off, like a prepaid cellphone number or would you go for a, rather anonymous email address?</p>
<p>An interesting topic to think about.</p>

		<h2 id="post-67"><a href="../../../../2007/02/16/the-value-of-money/index.html" rel="bookmark">The value of money</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../blog/college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on February 16th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Today&#8217;s economy is all about money, it has been like that for years and it will probably be like that for the remainder of time, unless someone comes up with an ingenious solution that replaces money with another object of value that is easy to exchange, both in the real world as well as digitally. Since I don&#8217;t see that happening any time soon, I might as well discuss an idea I had about teaching our young ones how to &#8220;work&#8221; with money.</p>
<p>Before we start, let&#8217;s take a minute to think back. I think I got my first money to spend at the age of seven, but I had been spending other people&#8217;s money (namely from my parents) before that. I would be rewarded for school activity as well as the occasional monetary present for birthdays. While this worked out nicely for me back then, I think the system is flawed. Later on, when you&#8217;re a grown-up, nobody will give you money just because you turn a year older. Well, some people might do, but those are the ones with bad taste, and it&#8217;s never going to be enough to sustain yourself. Basically, I think that parents are teaching their children nothing about the value of money by &#8220;just&#8221; giving them access to funds.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m proposing, basically, is the following: give children money, based on the work they carry out. Chores should of course be appropriate to their age, you can&#8217;t expect a five year-old to go shopping, you might end up with no money at all and a bill for the dentist. Have kids work around the house. Most children aren&#8217;t interested in that kind of stuff at those ages, so why not utilize a system that works so well, even primates pick up on it?</p>
<p>The &#8220;do this, get that&#8221; method is, if you ask me, a lot better than just giving kids an allowance that you replenish whenever the kids need it. Working for money is an essential factor of life, so why not start out as early as possible? Protecting your children from the harshness that is the world? Well, good luck with that. What good does that do? Ten years later, you have children who are completely incapable of managing the funds they have access to and you&#8217;ll end up having to teach them the whole system after all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read about people who taught their children the value of money in creative ways. Mom would tell her son to look through grocery fliers and the more coupons and great deals he could get, the more they would save. The saved money then, would be his reward. Does that teach children the value of money? You bet it does. The more you save, the more you get to keep. It&#8217;s as easy as that.</p>
<p>Now, in todays digital world, you could enhance the whole process a lot. Create a game I say. One that is a win-win solution for everyone involved, parents, children and the economy. If you&#8217;re going to create it, however, you should do it the right way. A famous Dutch financial institution tried and in my eyes, fail to meet the goal I&#8217;m trying for.</p>
<p>Said bank came up with a system that let&#8217;s you save money. You have a piece of hardware, connected to your computer. Put in a dime and you&#8217;ll see the computer process it in a visual way. You can always see how much you have, but you can&#8217;t really use it. It works great to teach people about saving money, but, in the end, why do we save money? Exactly, to spend it, when the time comes.</p>
<p>Their system lets children play games that are branded with the companies logos and everything. Every game costs a certain amount of points. You have x points every day and a game costs, say 1/10 of x. So you can play ten games a day. Very nice, if you want to keep your kid from turning into a gambler, but it doesn&#8217;t teach them anything about the real value. Like before, the problem is that the points are restored daily. In fact, parents can even buy more points for you, if need be.</p>
<p>My idea is different. Let&#8217;s create a game that combines online and offline chores. It&#8217;s gotta be entertaining to the kids, or they won&#8217;t play it, but it&#8217;s also gotta be educative. I propose to utilize the &#8220;do this, get that&#8221; method.</p>
<p>The application itself, would be aimed at an audience between three and six, so it would be heavy on the visual side and only include easy to read (and understand) text for the player. The application is basically a shell, your access to a myriad of minigames, some of which could be branded by the companies that support this game (and I&#8217;m certain, there would be quite a few).</p>
<p>Each minigame has to be entertaining. You&#8217;d have simple games, for example, stuff where you match pairs but also more advanced stuff, for example, reading easy words and linking them to their visual counterparts. After completing a level, the &#8220;boss&#8221; of that level is a real-world chore, related to the game. If you matched pairs ingame, why not go help your mom match socks? Sounds easy, but it would help both parents and children. The idea is that the kids first play something, then complete a chore, related to the game and finally get their reward. Both points in game as well as a monetary reward.</p>
<p>The game contains sophisticated tracking systems so that you can see how long your kid takes for a certain part, but I&#8217;d advise to spend the time on the computer <em>with</em> your kid, after all, there&#8217;s no better guardian than the one that&#8217;s there, when they need it. The tracking system also will show you statistics, like what does your child like to do most? What does it <em>not</em> like? You can then adjust the rewards in a way that for example, cleaning up the room, something just about every child hates, becomes a lot more interesting, financially speaking.</p>
<p>Heck, we could even digitize the aforementioned idea about having your kid look through grocery folders. Said minigame would have to be sponsored by a grocery store of course and the coupons would be for their products only. The player would be presented with a selection of say hundred coupons and then mark the ones that are of interest to him or her. Once the &#8220;level&#8221; is finished, call your parents, have them check the list, print it out and if they approve, enter a special parent-code™ that would translate into the reward.</p>
<p>Said parent-codes™ are printed lists with an unique identifier. There&#8217;s a pair of two codes each. One you have to enter before you start a game, one you have to enter after the player has completed a level. The game doesn&#8217;t handle situations where you start a game, then start another though because players are expected to only commit to something if they are willing to pull through. Much like in real life, later on.</p>
<p>All in all, this game has the potential to do three things: help children understand the value of money, help parents with their workload and help the economy create people who understand the value of money and brand children with brands they will be buying later on.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on February 14th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>February 14th, Valentine&#8217;s Day, a day that is traditionally used to express your love and affection towards those with whom you share a familiar love with, but also towards those you share romantic love with (and if you&#8217;re lucky enough to be able to have a 2-for-1 deal going, even better!)</p>
<p>Today is about showing your partner(s) how much you care about them, your chance to thank them for all the things they do. Things you might have started to take for granted, but believe me, they are not. So get out there (if you haven&#8217;t already done so) and surprise your loved one(s). They deserve it.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re at it, you might want to consider extending Valentine&#8217;s Day beyond it&#8217;s original scope of only showing your gratitude towards loved ones, you might want to think about including those people you admire too, like I&#8217;m about to do:</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve met a few years ago, yet it sometimes feels like only yesterday. We&#8217;ve been through good times and the obligatory bad times, we&#8217;ve even been through no-times, that is, the dark period without regular contact. We&#8217;ve shared secrets with each other that other&#8217;s still aren&#8217;t privy too and probably never will be.</p>
<p>Yes, we&#8217;ve had our fair share of disagreements but we managed to pull through, most of the time. Our friendship, if you want to call it that, has been faced with events that would have destroyed <em>any</em> other friendship, yet, ours miraculously survived, even if it was put on life-support by me soon thereafter. In hindsight, it seems hardly thankful, after all the things you&#8217;ve done for me and believe me, there isn&#8217;t a day I don&#8217;t feel guilty about it. That same guilt is what kept me from telling you this a lot sooner, that same guilt, is what keept me from hangin&#8217; out with you in the past.</p>
<p>In times of trouble, no matter which kind, you have stood by me, you have protected me and you stood up for me, even though <em>you</em> didn&#8217;t have to. <em>You</em> were there for me when I needed someone to talk to and you allowed me to help you when you needed someone to talk to.</p>
<p>You managed to captivate my mind and heart the day we first met and you continue to amaze me until this very day. You possess a gift, an inner strength that is unlike anything I have ever witnessed. You somehow overcome events that cripple others for a lifetime and even though I know that deep inside you, a little part of you succumbs to the pressure, you never show, you are always the same, blissful person.</p>
<p>I respect that and I admire you for it, a lot. So, here&#8217;s to you! You know who you are.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on December 31st, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>2006, was indeed, a great year. With lots of changes, both personally as well as professionally, this year will be something I&#8217;ll remember for a long time.</p>
<p>Filled with lots of new musical influences, courtesy of friends and <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a>, quite a few new skills, thanks to my college, employers and my own striving and a new appreciation for the arts of our culture - yes, 2006 did indeed kick some serious butt.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s one more thing that I want to get off my chest before I head out to conclude this past year in a fitting manner:</p>
<p>Happy New Year, may 2007 bring you and your loved ones the things you are longing for and if it does, think a minute about all those who aren&#8217;t able to live life in the same great way as most of us are able to, be it because of financial problems or because of other circumstances. If you are in the position, donate something to an organization you deem worthy of your support. It may not make you feel any better, but it will make someone else, somewhere else thankful. That should be rewarding enough, I know that it works for me.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a>, <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on December 29th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>This is the third and final part in a series of posts where I&#8217;m reviewing media from the past year. The <a href="../../../../blog/media/2006-a-readable-year-in-review/index.html">first part</a> discussed printed media, followed by <a href="../../../../blog/media/2006-a-televised-year-in-review/index.html">my thoughts on televised media</a>. The finale of this trilogy belongs to audible media, anything from music to spoken content.</p>
<p>2006, for me, marked the year of indie content. I bought more albums from <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">magnatune.com</a> this year than I did buy in retail stores during the last five years. Why? Because I like their concept. I get to choose how I acquire my media (loads of formats available), how much I pay and best of all &#8230; I get to share it with friends. Their concept is great and I&#8217;m thankful to them for providing such a great service.</p>
<p>Number one hit, for me personally, this year was certainly <strong>Scott Sigler&#8217;s Ancestor</strong>. While the story actually started in September of 2005, it wasn&#8217;t concluded until spring this year. Scott&#8217;s plot about xeno transplantation and the various side effects kept me hooked till the bitter end. Thanks to this <a href="http://www.podiobooks.com/podiobooks/book.php?ID=85">podiobook</a>, commuting actually became bearable.</p>
<p>Dubbed &#8220;medicine for the soul&#8221; by a commenter on YouTube, fingerstyle guitar artist <strong>Andy McKee</strong> really deserves a spot in my toplist. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn4MGaS3N4">The way</a> he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvar4ZsqsEo">makes love</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt1fB62cGbo">the guitar</a> is just amazing.  It&#8217;s just amazing how <a href="http://www.andymckee.com/">he</a> manages to convey a very vivid image with his song, without the need for any vocal support whatsoever.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Greys-Anatomy-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000AXWHQW/sr=8-4/qid=1167276155/ref=pd_bbs_4/002-8822490-8797649?ie=UTF8&#038;s=music">Grey&#8217;s Anatomy Soundtrack, Vol. 1</a> is the perfect candidate to conclude this review. Featuring songs from season one of the show, the compilation contains songs which have the power to make you feel happy. Out of the 15 songs on the disc, I personally like two thirds a lot and find the other third to be awesome. It rarely happens that I like more than half of a compilation&#8217;s songs, but this time, it&#8217;s spot on.</p>
