	<div class="main">
		<p>It is said that, to adequately express one&#8217;s feelings or opinion for any given subject, one must posses an elaborate vocabulary and what do you know. With anywhere between close to 450,000 and even up to a staggering 980,000 words, the English language has one of the richest, if not <em>the</em> vocabulary of all languages.</p>
<p>All those words, however meaningful or meaningless, hurting or caring, sweet or sour, apparently do not make for good company: Recent studies conducted across many Western Nations, including both English speakers and natives of other tongues, came to the conclusion that, based on the input the researchers received, people with a native background in English are less happy than people that were raised to speak another language.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, most of these studies showed that French native speakers always came out as one of the happiest groups and one might wonder how that can be, after all, French is said to contain a mere 100,000 words.</p>
<p>It would seem that the more basic a language gets, the happier its speakers become and this is certainly true for those people that truly embrace a language called <em>Toki Pona</em>. With only some 118 words at your disposal, many things simply stop mattering.</p>
<p><em>Toki Pona</em> however, is not the only language that can have a soothing and calming effect on one&#8217;s psyche. There are a great many artificial languages out there that were made to let you talk, listen and live in a more simplistic way and in fact, many parts of concept of Taoism are built around these very beliefs. </p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, many people, particularly those living in Western nations believe that (inner) bliss can only be achieved by having the latest gadgets, an expensive car, going on numerous butt-kicking vacations (with or without your family) and we can&#8217;t really forget jewelry, lots of it oh - and expensive clothes, shoes, maybe throw in a few plastic / corrective surgeries for good measure?</p>
<p>Do not get me wrong; I do not dislike stylish clothes or shoes and out-of-the-ordinary vacations or expensive gadgets, in fact, many people can at least attest to the last one, but still, at the end of the day, those things are not what make me really happy, they are means to an end; simply getting there &#8230; a place called bliss.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s definition of that place is probably different and one person might find it harder to get there than others, but do not let yourself be put off by some problems along the road - because when you are running out of game, <em>nothing</em> is more satisfying than being able to look back on a satisfying life. </p>
<p>In fact, many current printed publications, especially the ones aimed at women looking for &#8220;an easy way to tune out and relax with some trivial stories about stars no one really cares about anymore&#8221; talk about the power of positive thinking and while the larger part of them eschews the actual essence of that theory, they are at least managing to get people excited about the concept.</p>
<p>In the end, it all comes down to your mindset, success can not only be bred and inherited, but also be thought up. It is as simple as believing in yourself. It does wonders for your self esteem and that can, and actually does, make all the difference.</p>
<p>People with a high confidence rating are more likely to go out and do something crazy and ever so often, one of those crazy things pays off. After all, those that try, succeed, eventually. Yes, some manage to hit it big sooner rather than later, but in the end, success is inevitable. </p>
<p>Luck does not only favor the prepared, but also the bold - go out and rid yourself of the chains that are mass-consumption and you will be rewarded.</p>
<p>But I digress, back to <em>Toki Pona</em>, I realize that the language is, not at all, suitable for widespread, business use, but it is certainly very well suited for recreational and spiritual use and may offer you guidance in a way you thought impossible before.</p>
<p>The next time you feel sad or spent, pause for a minute and think about the situation you are in. Is it really as bad as you are imagining it or are you panicking and blowing things out of proportion? Bad things happen all the time, it is the way you deal with it that defines <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> you are. </p>
<p>Well, the only thing that is left to say now is: <em>mi wile sina jo pona tenpo</em>.</p>

		<h2 id="post-144"><a href="../../14/semi-public-meetings-of-geeks-one-month-later/index.html" rel="bookmark">(semi) public meetings of geeks - one month later.</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/index.html" title="View all posts in Tech Talk" rel="category tag">Tech Talk</a> on September 14th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Exactly one month ago, I <a href="../../../../tech-talk/semi-public-meetings-of-geeks/index.html">launched</a> <a href="http://www.xdaflameusers.com/">xdaflameusers.com</a>, a micro community aimed at providing XDA Flame users (d&#8217;oh) with a place to discuss, rant and rave (about) their Pocket PC.</p>
<p>During the last weeks, the site managed to attract some 90 users, who, collaboratively, created 824 posts. While this might not seem all that much when compared to, for example, <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/">xda-developers.com</a>, I am still very proud of what XFU (our hot, internal acronym) managed to accomplish.</p>
<p>On a more technical note, I am quite happy about the fact that we rank #1 on Google for not only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=xda+flame+hacking">XDA Flame Hacking</a> but also <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=xda+flame+forum">XDA Flame Forum</a>.</p>
<p>We have a #1 spot for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=xda+flame+user">XDA Flame User</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=xda+flame+user">XDA Flame Users</a> and we even managed to enter the forums with the rather generic <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=flame+forum">Flame Forum</a>.</p>
<p>We had the #1 and #2 spots after only ten days, which is quite a feat considering that we did not do anything in regards of SEO.</p>
<p>That said, while I spearheaded the idea of the site itself, I am certain that <del>I</del> we would not have made it this far without XFU&#8217;s awesome team:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.xdaflameusers.com/search.php?action=show_user&#038;user_id=8">Thierry</a> and <a href="http://www.xdaflameusers.com/search.php?action=show_user&#038;user_id=9">cwkj</a> have both been great moderators, asking interesting questions, coming up with great solutions and helping as needed.</p>
<p>My Second-in-command (so to speak), <a href="http://www.xdaflameusers.com/search.php?action=show_user&#038;user_id=21">leek</a>, on the other hand has not only focussed on providing great advice in the forums, but also kept himself (and, on occassion even me) busy with enhancing the forum in any way possible so that people who would use their Pocket PC to access the site would have the same (great) browsing / reading / commenting experience as those that would use a PC.</p>
<p><em>leek</em> of course is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Killough_(programmer)">Lee Killough</a>, famous not only for his ports of the computer game Doom, but also for his other works, such as, oh, working on supercomputers and other stuff I can not even begin to understand.</p>
<p>I feel privileged to be able to work with these guys and am glad that <a href="http://www.xdaflameusers.com/">xdaflameusers.com</a> turned out more hot than not.</p>
<div align="center">
Here&#8217;s to you guys, XFU would not be what it is, without you.<br />
Thank you.

		<h2 id="post-143"><a href="../../09/ramping-up-the-air-time/index.html" rel="bookmark">Ramping up the air time (Aspyr Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2)</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on September 9th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Approximately eight years ago, a company called Neversoft released a title that would shake up the sports game market. Aiming for a new audience with their game, Neversoft hired <a href="http://www.tonyhawk.com/">Tony Hawk</a> and tried to bring the excitement and fun of skateboarding to the living room, while at the same removing the injuries-factor from the equation and thereby  keeping parents happy.</p>
<p>After immense success, a follow-up tittle was released, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk's_Pro_Skater_2">Tony Hawk&#8217;s Pro Skater 2</a> (THPS2) and now, in 2007, released a <a href="http://www.aspyr.com/product/info/61">mobile version</a>.</p>
<p>Ever since I was first exposed to this game by my host family during my first stay in the US of A, I have been in love with this franchise and as such, I expect quite a lot from the Pocket PC version.</p>
<p><strong>Trucks and Wheels</strong></p>
<p>When I first started THPS2, I was greeted with that <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21555-1/thps2_1.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">familiar look</a> and in fact, the whole interface feels and looks like its bigger (and older) brother.</p>
<p>The game provides you with a variety of options, such as a very entertaining <em>Career Mode</em> with which you can unlock levels that can then be played in both the <em>Single Session</em> mode as well as the <em>Free Skate</em> mode.</p>
<p>Other than the various game types, the main menu also provides you with access to the <em>Create-a-Skater</em> tool and you can even build your own skate parks.</p>
<p>Naturally, the first thought that you might have is &#8220;great! a nice way of extending the game&#8221; but let me shatter your dreams right here, right now. Building a skate park is no easy feat and trust me, I have tried on both the Playstation version <em>and</em> on the Pocket PC version.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I should note that actually interacting with the park editor is quite easy. The buttons are set up in an easy to understand way and you have access to just about every item from the game itself.</p>
<p><strong>Sophisticated crate scooters</strong></p>
<p>THPS2 provides the user with a variety of unlockable options such as new board designs, which really only serve a visual purpose, but the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21610-1/thps2_17.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">money you earn</a> by completing various goals can also be used to buy stats and tricks.</p>
<p>When you upgrade your skater&#8217;s stats, you gain a range of new skills - such as more balance while grinding or longer airtime, which, in turn, means that you can earn more points, combined with a few new high-value tricks, you will be hitting those high scores in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Slides and Grinds</strong></p>
<p>Both the PC and the Playstation version of THPS supported joypads and in general, you needed one to be able to carry out all those amazing jumps and not get wiped out because you did not turn fast enough. The Pocket PC on the other hand does not support a joypad, simply because Windows Mobile is not set up for that.</p>
<p>The guys from Aspyr solved this problem by creating a hybrid control system where you utilize both your hardware buttons and three on-screen buttons for <em>flip</em>, <em>grab</em>, <em>grind</em> as well as a larger button for <em>jumping</em>.</p>
<p>Depending on how you <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21614-1/thps2_19.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">set up your game</a>, the right part of the screen will either be blacked out and only display <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21618-1/thps2_21.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">the buttons</a>, or, if you crank up the graphics a little, you will see the buttons as an overlay of the environment, similar to this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21602-1/thps2_13.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21603-2/thps2_13.png" alt="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system, in either configuration, works so well that you will be able to hit off huge combos with lots of points easily, although, you should probably not take <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21612-1/thps2_18.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">my skills</a> as an indicator for this.</p>
<p>One thing that is identical to the PC / PSX version however, is the amount of levels - THPS <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21582-1/thps2_3.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">includes</a> each <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21584-1/thps2_4.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">and</a> every <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21586-1/thps2_5.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">(default) level</a> that <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21588-1/thps2_6.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">was</a> also <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21590-1/thps2_7.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">present</a> in <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21592-1/thps2_8.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">the</a> original <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21594-1/thps2_9.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">version</a>, no <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21596-1/thps2_10.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[143]">kidding</a>.</p>
<p>The only thing that is missing, as far as I know, are the bonus levels, but apart from that, you can enjoy every skater, every trick, every board design and loads of great music in the Pocket PC edition.</p>
<p><strong>Skateboard Showroom</strong></p>
<p>For a Pocket PC game, THPS2 has awesome graphics if you ask me, most of all because it is 3D and and you can interact with the environment in a number of ways - you can knock over things, crash right through them, grind on rails and try to play catch-up with vehicles.</p>
<p>I believe that THPS2 is one of those games you have to see to understand the beauty of it really, so I created a three minute clip that showcases a run through the first level. All you have to do is (left) click on <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/kerimsatirli/tech-talk/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2.flv.html" title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2" >this link</a> and a new window will open with the video in it. A note of advice: the clip is 23mb in size, so you might not want to do this on a mobile connection unless you really <em>are</em> dying to see THPS2 in action.</p>
<p><strong>Tail guards</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://clickgamer.com/moreinfo.htm?pid=5660&#038;b=TECHTALK">Tony Hawk&#8217;s Pro Skater 2 for Pocket PC </a> is one of the best, if not the best, port of a PC-to-PPC game I have ever played. The control functions were ported in a very creative, yet usable, way and the game includes just about everything the original Playstation version included.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a (nearly) free roaming experience combined with a great sport, great graphics, the $20 you could spend on this game will seem a steal, considering the amount of joy you will get out of this title.</p>
<p><small>A thank you goes out to <a href="http://www.kevinvanbeers.com/blog/">Kevin van Beers</a> for volunteering his skating skills so I could record the clip.</small></p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on September 6th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>I went on a little road trip today (well, train trip really) to our capital to deliver a very special package to some people I know and when I came back, I met an old teacher / mentor from my high school and we got into a talk about the past, the present and the future.</p>
<p>Occasionally, it can be really interesting to meet people from the past, especially if those people expressed their doubts (albeit in a very subtle way) about your future before&#8230; this time around however, the cards were stacked in my favor.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not cranky or mad or anything about the behavior of (most of) my former high school teachers, but I find the way the situation has changed kind of amusing.</p>
<p>When I left high school, I set out into an uncertain future, or that&#8217;s what most of my teachers (wanted to?) believe(ed).</p>
<p>I was never really the poster student, nor did I try to be. I have this knack when it comes to learning: I generally only devote my attention to the things that <em>really</em> bother me and my old teacher confirmed that today, stating that I was &#8220;hard to reach&#8221; sometimes and teachers had a hard time &#8220;getting through to me&#8221;.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the day I started my college career, all those things seemed to have vanished. So far, I have had more than 70 different classes and to be honest, I found something that interested me in every single one of them.</p>
<p>Yes, some classes managed to pique my interest a lot more than others, but all in all, I did not have but one subject with which I was unhappy with.</p>
<p>In the end, this probably comes down to the fact that I made a great decision when it comes to college and had the luck of finding a place that teaches just about everything that I am interested in, but still, it is funny how things work out sometimes&#8230;</p>

		<h2 id="post-141"><a href="../../05/iphone-price-drop/index.html" rel="bookmark">iPhone Price drop</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/tech-talk/rants/index.html" title="View all posts in Rants" rel="category tag">Rants</a> on September 5th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>iPhone prices dropped by one third yesterday and apparently customers started reacting. This is just crazy:</p>
<blockquote><p>In response to yesterday&#8217;s iPhone price drop, a number of shootings in Apple stores across the country have been reported. Preliminary reports suggest that at least 15 people lost their lives in the line of duty.</p>
<p>Only two hours after the shooting, local police forces, working with the security firms that provide perimeter security to Apple stores, have been able to identify all the assailants and while no video footage has yet been officially released, our sources report that all gunmen appear to be early adopters of the iPhone platofrm.</p>
<p>Eye witness reports from different stores all claimed that the gunmen stormed into the store, armed with customer-level submachine guns and filled the iPhone demo stands with bullets. When approached by so-called Apple Geniuses and asked, in a calm, manner, to stop the shooting and put down the gun, many of the attackers seemed to snap and started shooting at the store&#8217;s employees.</p>
<p>Although many police departments deployed SWAT teams on-site almost immediately, the massacres could only stopped after the shooters ran out of ammunition, all the while police forces had to watch helplessly and try to contain the situations as good as possible.</p>
<p>Due to the large scale of this rampage, the FBI has taken interest in the case and will be conducting investigations.</p>
<p>A FBI spokeswoman would not give us any more comments at this time, stating that until a <em>thorough investigation</em> was conducted, everything was simply <em>speculation</em>. The FBI also would not comment on the backgrounds of the killers and their, possible, affiliations with each other.</p>
<p>Once again it becomes evident that Apple&#8217;s way of toying with it&#8217;s customers is not the right way to treat customers. Liberated in thinking by famous customer-related weblogs such as <em>The Consumerist</em>, this time, customers really did bite back, with lead.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder when companies will realize that the first adopters are, in part, the most important customers a company has, not only because they help iron out any bugs that made it through quality assurance, but also because these are the guys (and, of course, gals) that help create a buzz around your product and ensure that more people feed the machine&#8230;</p>
