		<description>Tom,

thanks for your input. I agree in as that the Kindle will help paving the way and "first generation" devices (not counting other dedicated eBook readers because they lack certain features the Kindle has) are never that great, but still, Amazon could have done a &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; better job at making it look good, after all, presentation is half of it.</description>

		<description>yeah, i thought the same of it. additionally also the price of kindle itself is too high.

i don't know if something like kindle will some day replace paper books for me - because while i am generally very open for new technology, books are something special.

but the idea of having every newspaper, blog and magazine in the world with me is great. then again the concept of having to pay for them is kind of ridiculous - at least as long websites are free.

and then, of course, kindle is ugly.

but i think it will help paving the way...</description>
