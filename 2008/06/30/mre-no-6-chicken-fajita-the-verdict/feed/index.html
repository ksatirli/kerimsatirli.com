		<description>Yeah I read about that. The longest period one is supposed to consume these is 21 days, provided that the Army / Corps / Service can get up mess halls by then, however, some troops have gone as far as three months on rations alone.

Given that you could probably get a different one every day, that does not sound too bad a deal really. Beats eating insects for sure.</description>

		<description>My buddy that has been in the military told me that he grew very tired of these after a while.  Many places where the U.S. Military is deployed have regular mess halls, and do not have to eat these on a regular basis.

At any rate, it's safe to say you have piqued my curiosity!</description>
