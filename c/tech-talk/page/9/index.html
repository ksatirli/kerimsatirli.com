		<p>Normally, I don&#8217;t blog this late (or early, depends on how you look at it) but I had to get some work done for a client of mine and as such, I kept checking my email every now and then for new stuff. I was just about to close down when the one email I&#8217;ve been waiting for for quite some time finally arrived.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Cerulean Studios</a> just opened up the <a href="http://www.trillianastra.com/">Trillian Astra</a> Alpha to a bigger group of testers, me included. Now, if you know me, you know that if there&#8217;s one thing I try to evangelize, it&#8217;s most definitely the software that, more or less, controls my online life. While this piece of software might be a simple replacement for MSN Messenger, AIM, Y! Messenger or Google Talk, Trillian, to me, is truly the hub of everything online.</p>
<p>Back in May 2006, the lead developer of Trillian offered people a chance to be included in the beta testing, I signed up and now, more than half a year later, I&#8217;m looking at the goodness that is Astra. I can&#8217;t write much about it, yet, since I haven&#8217;t anything, but rest assured, over the following days I will certainly blog about my favorite software some more.</p>
<p>For now, you&#8217;ll have to make do with this <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/lifeofacoder/missile-impact/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note: the title refers to a weapon system of the same name as the fourth version of Trillian is called. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_missile">here</a> for more information.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Tech Talk" rel="category tag">Tech Talk</a> on January 5th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>While checking my email today, I was a bit annoyed by my, seemingly, defunct <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">spam filter</a>. It seems that more and more mail is left untagged lately and more and more spam is ending up in my mailbox.</p>
<p>So while looking through the latest messages from people I never heard off and offers about mortgages and medicine I don&#8217;t need, I came across one of these messages from amazon.com - considering that I never buy there, cause they discriminate against people who don&#8217;t have access to a credit card, I was about to delete the message, when my fast-scanning eyes spotted a name I recognized: <a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/">Iliumsoft</a>.</p>
<p>Now, if you ever used a Pocket PC or Smartphone (or a Palm Handheld device, for that matter), you have probably heard of their premier application called <a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/ew/ewallet.htm">eWallet</a>. This application provides the perfect solution for people who do a lot of stuff online as well as off line. Me, I use it to store <em>anything</em> that I don&#8217;t want to see flying around, including personal details, important addresses as well as license keys for applications I bought.</p>
<p>After 18 months of development, Marc, Iliumsoft&#8217;s product manager, put out a call for help on their blog. The company was nearing the RTM stage of product development and needed some people to look at the product and put it through some stress testing to ensure that the application lived up to the expectations of the developers.</p>
<p>Thanks to a business kind-of relationship Marc and I established back when I was a reviewer for a tech site, I was included in the beta and was given a chance to look at eWallet 5.0 before the general public could.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been beta-testing software for about four years now, sometimes developers say &#8220;thank you&#8221;, sometimes you even get a license key and sometimes you end up with nothing but a timebombed application that will stop working a couple of weeks after the final product is released.</p>
<p>Iliumsoft however, values their testers. At the beginning of this week, Marc sent me an email with license keys for the whole eWallet range. The total of this &#8220;gig&#8221; alone comes down to a hefty $70 and to be honest, I wouldn&#8217;t have expected that. One key, of my own choosing, say Desktop or Smartphone, yes - but all four? Nope, I didn&#8217;t see that one coming.</p>
<p>However, as if that wasn&#8217;t generous enough, Iliumsoft also gifted me with this here:<br />
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/lifeofacoder/spam-filters-that-dont-work-are-a-great-thing/amazon_giftcertificate_from_iliumsoft.png.html"><br />
<img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/13867-1/amazon_giftcertificate_from_iliumsoft_smaller.png" alt="amazon.com gift certificate from Iliumsoft" /></a></p>
<p>this $20 gift certificate from amazon.com is Iliumsoft&#8217;s way of saying &#8220;thank you&#8221; and it&#8217;s awesome. Iliumsoft really wouldn&#8217;t have to do this, after all, they have enough momentum going for them as their reports <a href="http://blog.iliumsoft.com/?p=68">show</a>, yet they did. It seems that not everyone forgets where they &#8220;come from&#8221; once their sales go up. Keep it that way guys.</p>
<p>Marc and everyone else from Iliumsoft, it was most definitely my pleasure. Your responsiveness, be it in regards of support issues or feature suggestions is truly amazing. My Smartphone would be a useless piece of technology, if it weren&#8217;t for the data I collected within eWallet. You guys help me remember the things I am used to forgetting and I&#8217;m sincerely thankful for that.</p>

		<h2 id="post-16"><a href="../../../../2005/05/16/added-value-for-your-pocket-pc/index.html" rel="bookmark">added value for your Pocket PC</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on May 16th, 2005 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Most of us probably remember the Windows Plus! packages of tools Microsoft would distribute with Windows. A $30 to $50 Dollar price tag for stuff that didn&#8217;t really add value and hence didn&#8217;t make up to their name.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been a skeptic in regards of applications that have a &#8220;plus&#8221; in the name. Luckily however, SPB Softwarehouse is not about shallow promises but rather about &#8220;added value&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using PocketPlus since version 1, back then I received a complimentary code for my iPAQ as part of the iPaq Choice Programme. I didn&#8217;t really bother upgrading to version 2, which was released about a year ago. Thinking about it in retrospect, I&#8217;m sorry about this.</p>
<p>PocketPlus is not so much about tweaking your device but rather about adding those features Microsoft and your device manufacturer most certainly didn&#8217;t add. PocketPlus is by no means minimalistic, yet doesn&#8217;t come with too many options to make the user feel uncomfortable. Basically, PocketPlus is split into five different parts: &#8220;Close Button&#8221;, &#8220;Pocket Internet Explorer&#8221;, &#8220;Today Plug-in&#8221;, &#8220;Taskbar Battery Indicator&#8221; and &#8220;File Explorer&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong><u>closing chapters</u></strong><br />
Ever tried to close an active application on your Pocket PC without using the Memory Management? Good, then you know that it&#8217;s not possible without invoking a 3rd party application. PocketPlus offers you the possibility to either minimize applications or close them.</p>
<p>The minimize feature can come in helpful in situations where you started to read a book in Microsoft Reader (and you don&#8217;t want to endure the long startup again) or if you are using your Pocket PC to listen to music or podcasts. Press the &#8220;X&#8221; button, drag your stylus down - voila: instant minimize. Quite easy to remember.</p>
<p>Closing an application can come in handy in most other situations. You don&#8217;t have to worry about too much memory being eaten away by applications you are not using right now. Nice feature: you can list applications that should never be closed.</p>
<p>PocketPlus also includes a task managment utility in the menu that appears when tap-n-holding the &#8220;X&#8221; button. From rebooting to volume settings, as well as resolution switching - everything is there.</p>
<p><strong><u>Internet Enhancements?</u></strong><br />
The standard PIE doesn&#8217;t do much. No tabbed browsing, no ability to save a page, no nothing. PocketPlus&#8217; PIE enhancements cure all of those problems and even add new features.</p>
<p>For one, there&#8217;s a full screen switch, which is certainly helpful when you are reading forums or news. Then there&#8217;s the possibility to open more than one window at the same time and browsing on more pages simultaneously. Of course, those enhancements wouldn&#8217;t be complete without the ability to save pages and images and copy hyperlinks into to the clipboard.</p>
<p><strong><u>more Today, right now</u></strong><br />
PocketPlus&#8217; Today plugin let&#8217;s you have almost everything on your Today screen; be that a link to your favourite playlist or a shortcut to system settings - it&#8217;s all there.</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.clickapps.com/moreinfo.htm?pid=3996&#038;b=TECHTALK">PocketPlus</a> really lives up to it&#8217;s name. It&#8217;s certainly worth it&#8217;s price and it performed perfectly for me.</p>

		<h2 id="post-15"><a href="../../../../2005/04/28/new-toy-customized/index.html" rel="bookmark">new toy - customized</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../guides/index.html" title="View all posts in Guides" rel="category tag">Guides</a> on April 28th, 2005 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>I recently acquired a Qtek 9090 - this device is a so called Pocket PC Phone Edition and it&#8217;s pretty darn sweet. Apart from the usual stuff like WiFi, Bluetooth and an up to date OS, you also get GPRS connectivity, intelligent connection switching and a thumbkeyboard. All in all - a great package and certainly worth the money.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to it&#8230; Since the Qtek 9090 is really just a rebranded HTC Blue Angel (just like iMate PDA2k, Orange M200, O2 XDA III, T-Mobile MDA III), you can flash the device to your liking&#8230;</p>
<p>Basically, what HTC does is create 3 different &#8220;setups&#8221;. Those &#8220;setups&#8221; make the device what it is, including brand-customization (T-Mobile, O2, Orange, VodaFone etc.) and custom tools.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> is the operating system. HTC is using state of the art Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition.<br />
<strong>Part 2</strong> is the radio stack - this is what actually makes a device a phone edition. Without this, it&#8217;s just a normal Pocket PC. This stack  gets updated more or less frequently by your manufacturer and is best left alone unless you really know what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong> is the extended ROM. This let&#8217;s the manufacturer / OEM customize the device to their liking (not yours). These applications will be installed after each hard-reset. Most of the software included makes sense for someone, but most doesn&#8217;t make sense to me&#8230;</p>
<p>Since Qtek doesn&#8217;t really know about my specific needs, they include such great tools as a PPT Viewer, a PDF Viewer, FAXing utility, a Gallery application, a MIDlet utiliy and a Backup Utility. What I&#8217;d really need though is SPB Pocket Plus, a GPS application, a real backup utility and a few other applications. After deciding that it was more fun to have a customized device, rather than seeing all those unneeded applications, I set out to create a custom &#8220;extended ROM&#8221;.</p>
<p>Prior to starting, I did a good deal of reading in order to understand the whole concept of the phone, the website <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/">xda-developers.com</a> does a great job in explaining what actually is possible and how it has to be done. Creating your own &#8220;extended ROM&#8221; is easy, that is, if you know how. Here&#8217;s a listing that includes all the steps I did in order to get my  own ROM:</p>
<p><strong><u>- Preparation: Backups</u></strong><br />
Since I already trashed my old iPAQ H3660 back in the day, I knew I had to create a few backups at first. <a href="http://en.pdamobiz.com/en/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=151">PDAmobiz</a> has a good tutorial on how to create a backup of just about everything for your device. They walk you through the whole process and explain how you can retrieve the files. Since I wasn&#8217;t able to retrieve them, I&#8217;ve got a 256mb SD Card sitting around, waiting for the moment I pop it into the Qtek to reflash the extended ROM. Hopefully it will never get to that and I&#8217;ll only have to use my other SD Card, I&#8217;m using to create my custom extended ROM.</p>
<p><strong><u>- Preparation: getting to know the subject</u></strong><br />
Once again, <a href="http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=BA_ERK_Things2know">xda-developers.com</a> has a <a href="http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=BA_ERK_Understand">good deal</a> of <a href="http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=BA_ERK_Applications">information</a> in their <a href="http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=BA_RomKitchen">Wiki</a>.  Those pages outline what you need to know. Most questions will either be answered in the Wiki or you&#8217;ll find answers in the very active <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/">forums</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>- Preparation: Finding, testing the tools you need</u></strong><br />
Prior to putting something into the &#8220;extended ROM&#8221;, it&#8217;s necessary to test the install routine on the device and see what <a href="http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=BA_ERK_Things2know">kind of routine</a> it is.</p>
<p>Testing is done by locating the .cab File in your ActiveSync Folder and copying it onto the device, rather than using ActiveSync&#8217;s installation utility. It&#8217;s important to note here if an application needs user interaction (entering a key, accepting an EULA etc.) or not. This will influence how &#8220;config.txt&#8221; will be created later on.</p>
<p>My list of applications consists of the following right now:<br />
<a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/products/pocketplus/">SPB Pocket Plus</a> by <a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/">SPB Software House</a> - application requires user interaction (question about ZIP support)<br />
<a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/ew/ewallet.htm">eWallet</a>, by <a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/">Iliumsoft</a> - application requires user interaction (accepting EULA).<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/reader/downloads/ppc.asp">Microsoft Reader</a> by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> - application requires user interaction (notice about new fonts)<br />
<a href="http://www.66.com/route66/products.php?cid=UK&#038;prodid=832">Route 66</a> and <a href="http://www.66.com/route66/support.php?cid=UK&#038;sec=2&#038;ssec=1">SP2</a> by <a href="http://www.66.com/">Route 66 GIS b.v.</a> - application requires user interaction (warning about functionality)<br />
Apart from installing those applications, I also want my &#8220;extended ROM&#8221; to include my registration for Microsoft Reader, since I already know which <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/mobile/archives/20040818_microsoft_reader_on_the_pocket_pc_back_up_your_activation.phtml">files</a> are important. In later steps it may be interesting to edit the dump of an registry file so that after installing all the software, the dump would import my registration keys and save me the hassle of entering them myself.</p>
<p><strong><u>- Preparation: extracting the original ROM</u></strong><br />
Before you can actually extract the original ROM, you will have to unlock and unhide it. This is done by using the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/a3oay">XDA Unlock Tool</a>, however this version will only work on devices with an English interface. Since my device is based on the German version, I had to copy a few files to different places, but all in all it&#8217;s easy to start. After executing the application, you will have to do a soft-reset (the small hole, left bottom corner) and a directory called &#8220;Extended_ROM&#8221; will appear at the root level when you open Explorer on your device. In this folder you will find all the applications that are installed to customize your device.</p>
<p><strong><u>- Preparation: creating a custom config.txt</u></strong><br />
The most important files in the &#8220;Extended_ROM&#8221; directory are &#8220;config.txt&#8221; and &#8220;AutoRun.exe&#8221;. The latter takes the text file as a guideline on what to do. The format of the text file is <a href="http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=AutoRun">rather simple</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;EXEC:\Extended_ROM\application.exe&#8221; - executes a file. Most notably is that &#8220;TPDisable.exe&#8221; is executed at the beginning. This keeps the user from doing anything with the touch screen. &#8220;TPEnable.exe&#8221; will restore touch screen functionality after the customization.</p>
<p>&#8220;CAB:\Extended_ROM\application.cab&#8221; - executes a CAB installer. It&#8217;s probably logical, but I should still mention that the CAB file has to be written for your device (e.g.: StrongARM) or else the customization will most probably fail.<br />
There&#8217;s also a built-in facility to copy files from the &#8220;extended ROM&#8221; to anywhere I please. This will later be discussed regarding the activation of MS Reader.</p>
<p>Since all my applications require some kind of interaction, I don&#8217;t really need to disable the touch screen, therefor I start out by editing the factory version of the config.txt to not execute &#8220;TPDisable.exe&#8221; anymore, naturally &#8220;TPEnable.exe&#8221; will then not be needed either.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/viewtopic.php?t=16137">this thread</a> on <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/">xda-developers.com</a>, I know which files I can safely remove and which should better remain in the &#8220;extended ROM&#8221;. Like I noted earlier, I don&#8217;t see any reason why I should install a PPT or PDF viewer, since I never read such files anyways, so all I have to do is remove &#8220;ClearVue2.4.381_GER_withoutBP_OzUp.sa.CAB&#8221; from the &#8220;config.txt&#8221; and the application wont be installed next time I do a hard-reset. To save space (since the &#8220;extended ROM&#8221; is limited to 16mb), I also removed the file itself. It should be noted that the &#8220;GER&#8221; is the language code and could also be &#8220;ENG&#8221; or &#8220;ITA&#8221; or anything else.<br />
I also have little need for the following applications:<br />
&#8220;BA_Album_GER.CAB&#8221; (the Gallery application),</p>
<p>&#8220;Java_v10.1.2.49_DE_0901_unremovable.CAB&#8221; (the MIDlet manager) and<br />
&#8220;Fax_v2.09_BA_GER_0720_unremovable.CAB&#8221; (the FAX application), so I also removed those.</p>
<p><strong><u>- Testing: Will my config.txt work?</u></strong><br />
All I have to do now is upload my &#8220;config.txt&#8221; to the &#8220;Extended_ROM&#8221; folder and do a hard-reset. After a hard-reset, I should have a device with less useless tools installed, and while it actually appears that I&#8217;m writing this after doing the customization, it is in fact being written as I try out the different steps.</p>
<p>I just did a hard-reset (with some hesitation) and it worked. So far so good.</p>
<p><strong><u>Experimenting: stripping more unneeded tools</u></strong><br />
Since I don&#8217;t really use MIDI ringtones, I also decided to remove the MIDI Tools &#8220;MIDI561.CAB&#8221; and the registration file for it, called &#8220;MIDI_GER_reg.CAB&#8221;. The updated config.txt goes into the &#8220;extended ROM&#8221; folder once again and another hard-reset shows the results. To conclude this part, I also ended up removing &#8220;MMS_v2.0.0.16_BA_DE_20041115.CAB&#8221; - the MMS Client, since I never send MMS and &#8220;Qtek_Button9_GER.sa.CAB&#8221; - an utility that maps a button to the Sprint PCS website. This saved me another 2.25mb.</p>
<p><strong><u>Experimenting: adding much needed tools</u></strong><br />
Since the &#8220;extended ROM&#8221; is limited to 16mb, I had to find a solution for making some room. The factory default takes up 14mb, but I removed 7.71mb and thus have 9.71mb free. This might be a problem for others, since they might want to install more applications. In that case, I suggest storing the CAB files in &#8220;\Storage&#8221; since those 43mb located to this non-volatile storage might otherwise go unused.</p>
<p>When adding applications, it might be smart to create folders like I did, one called &#8220;ms_reader_activation&#8221; where all the files reside that make up the activation and another folder called &#8220;custom_apps&#8221; that holds the CAB files for the installer.<br />
To copy the MS Reader files automatically, you&#8217;ll have to use the &#8220;CPY1&#8243; and &#8220;CPY2&#8243; commands as outlined above.<br />
I also <a href="http://www.ocpsoftware.com/products.php?nm=cecabmgr">edited</a> some of the CAB files to make them even smaller: I removed the GuideBook.lit from the MS Reader Setup and I deleted the standard images / icons / sounds that come with eWallet. I also edited the eWallet CAB in a way that it automatically registers itself with my credentials. Apart from that, I changed the location where eWallet looks for images to a folder in &#8220;\Storage&#8221;.</p>
<p>After the customization, the device will soft-reset itself and everything will be installed, copied and set up.<br />
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> creating your own &#8220;customization tool&#8221; is really not that  difficult, as long as you read about it first and follow all steps as outlined. For me, I &#8216;ve got my very own and higly customized Qtek 9090 now.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a>, <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Tech Talk" rel="category tag">Tech Talk</a> on February 26th, 2005 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>As discussed <a href="../../../../tech-talk/ebook-goodness-from-fictionwisecom/index.html">earlier</a>, I ordered quite a few eBooks recently. Here&#8217;s the verdict:</p>
<p>eBooks are awesome. I love the way you can carry them with you all the time (on your Pocket PC) and read when it suits you best - in the train, while you&#8217;re waiting for a teacher &#8230;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the only thing, after all - you could carry your average paperback with you as well, what you can&#8217;t do though is carry 15 paperbacks with you, not if you care about your back at least. You can however carry 15 eBooks with you. Since the books are just files on a storage card, you don&#8217;t add any weight to your package.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also experience trouble when trying to read a paperback in the dark, you will however be able to read any eBook in the darkest cave, since eBook reading devices have a back lit display.</p>
<p>Not enough to convince you? Let&#8217;s focus on some other aspects then:<br />
eBooks are cheaper than paperbacks most of them time and you don&#8217;t need half a tree to print 100 books. Ever lost your bookmark and cursed about not being able to find the right page? You won&#8217;t experience that with eBooks - digital bookmarks don&#8217;t get lost.</p>
<p>Naturally, like everything, there are two sides to it:<br />
eBooks don&#8217;t stack up nicely in your shelf, so you can&#8217;t show off your library and reading an eBook depends on a battery needed to power your reading device, you don&#8217;t have those problems with paperbacks.</p>
<p>All in all, reading eBooks is awesome. I&#8217;m certain that I&#8217;ll be reading <strong>a lot more</strong> in the future.</p>
