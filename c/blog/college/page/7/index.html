	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on January 13th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Yesterday marked the last day of the winter-term of my second year in college. After 8 weeks of research, meetings, brainstorming, writing, editing and rendering, our vision of the future is finally done.</p>
<p>2046 will be the year of the <strong>MindNet</strong> and the <strong>MindLink</strong>, two utilities that will enhance our daily life in ways unknown to mankind before then:</p>
<p>The <strong>MindNet</strong> is the natural evolution of the Internet. It all started out a few decades ago as a network for scientists, now (2007), the web is a place to meet interesting people and broaden your knowledge, but only a small part is accessible via conventional means (search engines). This will change, over the next few years we&#8217;ll see more and more things being available as an online solution, the concept of PCs will not disappear but it will change radically. Your data isn&#8217;t bound to a geographical location (read: your PC&#8217;s harddisk) anymore, it will be available everywhere, only to you, unless you decide to share it.</p>
<p>The <strong>MindNet</strong> is part knowledge base, part search engine, part smart summarizer and part entertainment solution. You don&#8217;t have to be able to ask the perfect question to get a perfect answer, no, by means of narrowing it down and automagical content analysis, the MindNet will hook you up with the information <em>you</em> are looking for.</p>
<p>The <strong>MindLink</strong> is the device that enables you to access the MindNet. Wearable Technology, first introduced at the beginning of this century was the first step towards the MindLink. Human interfaces, seen in Tablet PCs and Nintendo&#8217;s Wii combined with the first mind controlled harddisk, which were made available to consumers in 2012 mark an important step towards the change our interaction with computers underwent.</p>
<p>Silicon-based computing hit a roadblock, so to speak. Technology couldn&#8217;t get any smaller anymore, so the move towards organic computing, which was based on research and development carried out since the late nineties, was inevitable.</p>
<p>Organic computers were so powerful, that mankind was able to solve many of the environmental issues that emerged during the beginning of the century. With the new processing power, scientists also built artificial brains that helped in the R&#038;D process towards a system that would allow people to download (and upload) data into their brains. Only a few years later, the first non damaging connection to a human brain had been established.</p>
<p>The <strong>MindLink</strong> enables the user to tap into a vast array of knowledge, not just raw data but processed information that could be used right from the start&#8230;</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../projects/index.html" title="View all posts in Projects" rel="category tag">Projects</a> on December 11th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been working on a <a href="http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/">Battlefield 2</a> based movie. Machinima movies always intrigued me and I wanted to shoot a film in 2006 anyway, so I thought that I might as well combine those two.</p>
<p>During the summer months, I started writing a story about the war some soldiers have to fight during the actual war. Since the movie is based on Battlefield 2, we&#8217;ll have loads of American and Middle Eastern actors and I&#8217;m doing my best to create micro stories around each and every important character. Granted, only five or six of them really are important, but you&#8217;ll probably know a lot more about them by the end of the movie.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not willing to break the story yet, but I wanted to talk about something relating to this movie:</p>
<p>During my first year in <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a>, we spent two weeks in a short-term project called &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221;. The idea behind said project is that the only thing your tutor gives you is a word, no idea, no limits, just a word. Ours was &#8220;waiting room&#8221; and during the two weeks the project lasted, we (a small group of four students) came up with a less than greatly executed solution. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the idea we had really had (and has) potential, but the way we executed it just wasn&#8217;t up to par.</p>
<p>Those two weeks were really the only time during that year I regretted, I didn&#8217;t learn anything (new) and we (all) created tension that, for a certain part, still lingers around and influences current decisions, nine months after &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221; concluded.</p>
<p>This year, I wanted to do something different, I wanted to do something productive and expand my knowledge. Normally, &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221; in the second year links up with a very short internship (of ten working days) at a company that will probably help you make a final decision as to which profile you&#8217;re going to choose for the last two years of your college career. I was really looking forward to that internship and even got in touch with a print shop, because, well, printing stuff, the right way, is something I&#8217;m interested in.</p>
<p>Long story short, we were supposed to have some sort of orientational period this year but it won&#8217;t be an internship - a pity, if you ask me. Then again, I already know what I&#8217;m going to do next year and I don&#8217;t want to waste another two weeks, just to regret them two months from now (FreeSpace is coming up at the end of January 2007).</p>
<p>So, not wanting to waste another two weeks of my short time in college, I decided to put in some work and talk to the man. I <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/lifeofacoder/its-about-how-you-sell-it/bf2_movie_project_pitch_20061211_02_enUS.pdf.html">pitched my idea</a> for the movie in the most business-like way I could imagine and guess what? It worked.</p>
<p>Turns out, the people I pitched my idea to where sold after about the first minute, out of the ten minutes I talked. Apparently, it&#8217;s just about how you sell it and if you do it the right way, your college will even give you permission to play a game and earn some credits with it.</p>
<p>(Naturally, I&#8217;m not just playing a game, I&#8217;m actually writing a scenario, drawing up story boards, locating suitable actors and supporting actors, dabble with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition/">Adobe Audition</a> to clean up the audio, work with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/nl/products/premiere/">Adobe Premiere</a> to cut and edit, use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/">Adobe After Effects</a> to create flashy effects and finalize the whole thing in Flash Video with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/">Adobe Flash</a>.)</p>

		<h2 id="post-34"><a href="../../../../../2006/11/29/next-night-10/index.html" rel="bookmark">Next Night 1.0</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on November 29th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>So I didn&#8217;t find any time to blog about the Next Night last night, mostly because I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable pulling out my laptop while everyone was listening but let me tell you that it itched in my fingers &#8230; so without furder ado, I&#8217;ll write up a short re-cap of yesterday&#8217;s events:</p>
<p>FYI: Next Night 1.0 was about Gamevertising and Advergames, putting ads into games and creating games to increase brand awareness and get people to buy your products.</p>
<p>The evening started out with us (<a href="http://inmyvision.net/">Jack</a>, me) being a bit late, thanks to the horrible public transport service currently offered. We missed the first half of the first keynote but managed to catch the second half. It was interesting, but didn&#8217;t rock.</p>
<p>Then came a duo of speakers who really knew how to cater to this audience - <a href="http://www.mediamonks.nl/">MediaMonks</a>. Those guys were cocky, in a great way. They showcase&#8217;d some of their projects and the way they approached projects. Most of the people I talked to agreed that their presentation was without a doubt the best one. Not just because of their interesting presentation style, involving two very different people (one a media strategist, the other a creative technologist) who didn&#8217;t see eye to eye on some issues and mocked each other in a respectful way, but also because of the time they took to answer our questions in a very honest way.</p>
<p>I took some time to read up on them before I went to the event and from what I gather, their company must be one of the best you could work for, if you&#8217;re looking for a great team of highly creative, highly energetic minds.</p>
<p>The last speaker was a guy from the University of Amsterdam, a true researcher who discussed how bad it would be to put advertising into games like World of Warcraft. You could tell by the way he was talking that he was a true addict, trying to protect &#8220;his precious&#8221;. I disliked the fact that he couldn&#8217;t really stay objective. Like, he &#8220;sanctioned&#8221; advertising for games like FIFA &#8216;07, because of the added realism, but bashed advertising in games like Battlefield 2142.</p>
<p>He, on the other hand, liked the sort of viral marketing Microsoft used for marketing Halo 2 (ILoveBees) and appreciated that Rockstar Entertainment created loads of spoofs for their GTA series of games. I&#8217;m just baffled as to why he decided not to talk about Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. A modern-day game using modern day advertisement for products like Wrigley&#8217;s chewing gum, Axe body spray, powered by Massive Inc.&#8217; in-game advertising technique. Other than that, he also forgot to mention older games like Tony Hawk&#8217;s Pro Skater 2, 3 and similar games which actually live on in-game advertising to add a new layer of realism to the game.</p>
<p>Summarizing, the first Next Night, if you ask me, was a total success. It&#8217;s not yet a high-octane event, but if they continue like this, they will be.<br />
The best thing about Generation Next? It&#8217;s a kind of fraternity and no one even knew.</p>
<p>When I started out in college, I decided not to join any fraternity, because I didn&#8217;t see the added value of it. I also didn&#8217;t want to go thru various introductory rites like drinking blood from a chicken or running around naked. Generation Next on the other hand is different, they don&#8217;t have that kind of crap, you don&#8217;t have to pay any fees and it&#8217;s not obligatory to get drunk every Wedneday through Friday. What you do get, however, is a great community of creative and very motivated people as well as valuable business contacts with the people you&#8217;ll be either working for or with in the years to come.</p>
<p>Congrats to the <a href="http://www.generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a> team for setting up an awesome event. If you guys are looking to start a &#8220;street team&#8221; in my college, I&#8217;ll gladly help out!</p>

		<h2 id="post-32"><a href="../../../../../2006/10/22/too-busy-to-be-productive/index.html" rel="bookmark">too busy to be productive?</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../../personal-stuff/index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on October 22nd, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>So, it&#8217;s been ten days again since I last blogged and while I do have a few things I want to discuss, I thought I&#8217;d get this one out:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s once again the last week of a term, midterms are coming up (well, one anyway) and our current project is due to be <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/11637-2/smarties_presentation_20061022_03.pdf">presented</a> in a few days, too. We&#8217;ll see how that goes &#8230; I&#8217;m hoping good, but I&#8217;m prepared for bad too.</p>
<p>So, currently when you switch on the TV or read any newspaper, you&#8217;re guaranteed to come across someone talking about how little time we have and how precious it is and all &#8230;</p>
<p>If you ask me, we don&#8217;t have little time, we just choose to spend it the wrong way. As a student, I know that I &#8220;waste&#8221; loads of sparetime during the last week of a project because I choose to procrastinate quite a long time; granted, it works out every single time, but I&#8217;m certain that I&#8217;d have more free time and less stress if I&#8217;d start finishing stuff earlier.</p>
<p>Then again, it seems that when I create stuff last-minute, I always come up with stuff I&#8217;m happy with. I&#8217;ve talked to other students and I know they feel the same way. My guess is that this is just the way creative people choose to work and to be honest, this way of working has advantages too.</p>
<p>If you prepare stuff weeks up front, you&#8217;ll not be able to incorporate up-to-the-minute information into your article, presentation, discussion, simply because you don&#8217;t know up front what&#8217;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you start out too early, your creation might lack &#8220;depth&#8221;. I&#8217;d like to take an essay I wrote a year ago as an example. The task was to discuss a media landscape, I choose the <a href="http://www.scifi.com/">SciFi Channel</a>, finished my text three (!) weeks up front and ended up rewriting the whole piece from scratch the night before it was due, turns out the text I wrote during the second pass was something I&#8217;m really proud of, while the text I wrote up front was sub-par.</p>
<p>So, while in general it might seem like a bad idea, it seems to be a very acceptable (and already accepted) way for creative people to create stuff. Granted, you sacrifice loads of sparetime in the last days prior to the deadline, but then again, you already used that sparetime up front anyway.</p>
<p>[UPDATE]:</p>
<p><a href="http://inmyvision.net/">Jack</a> seems to be experiencing a similar <a href="http://inmyvision.net/?item=tijd-wie-heeft-het-tegenwoordig-nog">problem</a>, having too little time to do stuff he likes.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on October 12th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Ten days ago, I <a href="../../../../../blog/college/can-i-help-you-with-anything/index.html">attended</a> an edu-fair as a student advisor. Thinking back, it was probably one of the most interesting experiences I had while performing any job I had so far. The team was great, the aura was great and we had lots of fun. In essence, that&#8217;s all you need to have a <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/">good time</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I attended another edu-fair, again, as a student advisor and I was actually looking forward to it. I was hoping that we could top the amount of fun we had last time, help more people and get to know some more people, but alas - the experience was rather &#8230; disappointing.</p>
<p>A few years ago, back when I was about to decide which college to go to, my options were a <a href="http://www.stjoost.nl/">purely artistic college</a> and a rather <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">young college</a>, with courses focussed towards communication and multimedia design.</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t really see myself as an &#8220;analogue artist&#8221; but rather a digital one, I opted for the second one. Sometimes I think back, how it could have been. After all, the first mentioned college trained some of the Netherlands most famous artists and to be allowed to join those ranks would be something great certainly. Either way, I don&#8217;t regret my decision and I&#8217;m proud to be a &#8220;CMD student&#8221;.</p>
<p>Back on topic, yesterday I got my first chance to talk to a tutor from the artists college and gosh &#8230; that lady has some serious issues. Sure, their college is great, many great people graduated there, but I don&#8217;t personally consider that a reason to rant about other colleges. No matter if they&#8217;re part of your own college group (like my college) or not.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t do it, a few of them being that it is immature, very unprofessional and that it&#8217;s just plain wrong, yet that tutor decided that her college was better than others and felt obligated to carry out her verbal battle with me in front of a possible future student. She went on about how students from my college are less artistic and less creative and how their students are the true Picassos, Van Goghs etc.</p>
<p>I discussed this issue with a few students (from my college) and all of them agree that her behaviour was plain wrong. I personally think that the student in question wont join us next year, after all - the first impression he got from our school was that we like to bitch.</p>
<p>Now, if that lady decides to rave about her own college, I&#8217;d like her to go right ahead, but she shouldn&#8217;t do it at the cost of our, or any other college, for that matter.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, their stand was also the only one that didn&#8217;t fit the CI of our 9 other stands. She decided that their stand deserved loads of posters and empty soda cans on the table, even though we were told to make sure that all stands looked as clean and inviting as possible at any time during the fair.</p>
<p>That said, all in all the fair was less disappointing than that incident but still not great. Most people weren&#8217;t really motivated to promote their courses in an interesting way and I&#8217;m quite sure that most people interested in our college were getting a totally wrong impression.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re one of the people who stopped by yesterday and think that our college isn&#8217;t really &#8220;gezellig&#8221; and just blows, I apologize. Feel free to come to one of our walk-in days, for example the one on November 18th, 2006. We&#8217;ll be present with a great team from 10 am till 3 pm and you&#8217;ll  be able to experience our &#8220;chemistry&#8221;.</p>
