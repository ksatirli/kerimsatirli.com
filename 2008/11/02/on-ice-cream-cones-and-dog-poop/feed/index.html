		<description>Hmm...I would choose the second one, but I would stop to quickly scrape the bottom of my shoe on the grass and then continue to walk while enjoy my ice cream...and I could go for tasty chocolate, juicy strawberry or delicious mango right now....mmmm.</description>

		<description>Ahhh... this sounds like a GabeB quote!

Hey I'd like to point out the very real possibly that in another reality you COULD be eating a steam, slick, sticky poop turd while stepping on someone's melted ice-cream.

THEN what would you do?

That's right. You throw down the poop-scoop ASAP and start licking the ground before the ice-cream walks away on you on someone else's shoe.

Don't let this be YOUR reality. Don't take any shit fed to you and starting from the ground floor up can always be a tasty sweet experience.

This has been a NunoXEI moment. Thank you.</description>

		<description>That is an excellent quote - thank you very much for deciding to share it.  There are so many ways to parallel that story, and so many different lessons to learn.  Please pass on my compliments!</description>
