		<description>Thanks robb. I haven not yet used the full body coverage shields yet, but if I had a compatible device, I most certainly would :)

As far as the product not being available goes, you should just write them an email, telling them that you are interested in the full body shield for the Flame; the more people tell them so, the more likely it is that they will actually make one!</description>

		<description>Hey, nice text. What do you think of a full body coverage invisibleSHIELD which are recently introduced. For me it is fantastic, you can forget about other protective cases (lether,metal, etc.). But unfortunately not for Flame yet :(</description>
