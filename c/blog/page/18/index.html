		<p>Hot on the heels of Fast Company&#8217;s announcement about <a href="../../../../blog/media/fast-cities-2007/index.html">Fast Cities</a> and the lack thereof as far as Europe goes, Saul Klein and Reshma Sohoni announced their newest initiative called <a href="http://www.seedcamp.com/">Seedcamp</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/07/launching-seedcamp.html">Klein</a>&#8217;s vision is simple:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re looking for the brightest and the best young entrepreneurs across Europe, Middle East and Africa to blow us away with their ideas for game-changing businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s even better is that Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten, of <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-recap/index.html">The Next Web</a> fame, decided to <a href="http://bomega.com/2007/07/12/seedcamp/">provide some additional exposure</a> to two of the selected Seedcamp teams.</p>
<p>Watch out Fast Company, next year, Europe will most certainly have a lot more to show than we did this year.</p>

		<p>In today&#8217;s highly linked world, one might say that the geographical location of a business does not matter anymore, after all, the Internet lets you work with anyone, anytime anywhere, right?. Wrong, businesses still depend on good locations and there are people out their that want you to help with finding the right one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a>, just published their <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/cities/2007/">2007 listing</a> of <em>Fast Cities</em>. The list is essentially a guide on great (perfect?) places to start your new business:</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re smart, young, newly graduated from a university with the whole world before you. You could settle in a small town with well-tended lawns, pancake suppers, and life on a human scale. Or you could truck it to the big city, with all its din and dog-eat-dog lunacy. Your choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>While the list in itself is pretty interesting and contains good advice on the various hot spots, I wonder why so few European cities and especially not one Dutch city made the cut.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a kind <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-morning-recap/index.html">fright</a> amongst European companies as far as innovation and great business ideas go, but still, we aren&#8217;t doing <em>that</em> bad, are we?</p>
<p>Microsoft choose to beta test their <a href="http://www.live.com/">Live</a> service in the Netherlands first. Why? Because we have the highest broadband penetration in the whole western world.</p>
<p>Whenever you check out new technology, there is some kind of Dutch influence. Be i that we helped produce the product, helped support it or just am the nation with the most users of said product.</p>
<p>We might not always come in first, but we surely are not the last ones to finish, so why are we not on the Fast City listing?</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on July 4th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>On Wednesday, I officially finished my second year in <a href=http://www.cmd-breda.nl/>college</a> and I‚Äôm kind of glad that we finally got some time off. Our learning environment is highly competitive and filled with stress, especially in the final days, hours, minutes of a project. While I don‚Äôt have any problem coping with the stress and actually enjoy it, at times, it‚Äôs quite nice to not have to get up way too early and not have to prepare something.</p>
<p>The second year provided me with interesting insights, especially in regards of Flash ActionScript (still AS2 though), Processing (a powerful little IDE) as well as interaction design. We‚Äôve conceptualized and built a great many things, some better than others. All in all however, it was a good year, not as great as it could have been, but definitely not sub par. The end of year 2 also marked the time where our groups split up to specialize in one of four areas of expertise:</p>
<p>For all those that are interested in creating the visual part of a CI, love to play with typography and create posters, <i>media design</i> is the way to go.</p>
<p>For those looking to create concepts for great ideas and better understand the psychology behind selling a product to customers, <i>interaction strategy</i> will be the profile of choice.</p>
<p>For those that are training to be interaction designers, with a deep understanding of user interface and user experience design, <i>information and interaction</i> will be the best solution.</p>
<p>And, finally, for the (rather small) group of people that wants to specialize in the development of Rich Internet Applications and web services in general, as well as interactive setups and discovering new trends, <i>creative technology</i> is going to be the name of the game.</p>
<p>Given my interest in technology, I opted for the creative technology set of classes. After talks with people who already work in the very field I plan on working in, I realized that a strong understanding of the technical side, paired with a sense for marketing is the best way to go.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll see how good (or bad) a choice this will turn out to be&#8230;</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on June 8th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>The first edition of The Next Web conference featured an after-party that was held at Boris‚Äô private residence in the heart of Amsterdam, five minutes from the venue where the conference was held. While I‚Äôm certain that Boris could have rented a huge party area, I loved the fact that he managed to keep the whole thing on a very social level. Basically, it was like meeting some old friends for a quick beer after work. Only difference to a normal ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù was that those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were specialists and gurus such as Kevin Kelly, AMS-IX and mabber.com representatives, among many others. The personal aspect, combined with a location that provided users with four (geographical) areas to hold conversations, proved most useful for networking purposes.</p>
<p>This year, Boris decided to rent the famous club / restaurant / all-round great place Odeon, one of Amsterdam‚Äôs hottest bars and the main location of the 2006 after party. Great move on Boris part, ‚Äòcause it prevented the group from breaking up too soon. Out of the approximately 500 people that attended the conference, some 150 showed up for the Dinner at the Odeon and, after some small talk, enjoyed a great dinner, with each other.</p>
<p>Prior to the actual dinner, I came across Marjolijn van den Assem, Boris mother and engaged her in a conversation about the conference and the day‚Äôs events. Even though van den Assem isn‚Äôt your typical Web 2.0 conference attendee, it was obvious that she really paid close attention to what the speakers at the conference talked about.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, I managed to get a seat at the Veldhuijzen van Zanten table that was a bit more secluded that the rest and provided a great environment for interesting talk. I happened to know van den Assem from Boris <a href=http://www.bomega.com/>blog</a> and I have to say that I haven‚Äôt had such an interesting conversation in a long time. As a person who is deeply interested in Nietzsche, van den Assem devoted the last 30 years of her life to studying the teachings of the scientist. Her work was recently published in a book called ‚ÄúSeelenbriefe‚Äù.</p>
<p>Talking to van den Assem is a cleansing experience; she, unlike others, really listens to what you have to say and isn‚Äôt afraid to share her own experiences with you, basically, this is all you need to keep a conversation going for a long time.</p>
<p>Then, at 8 pm, Veldhuijzen van Zanten kicked off the <a href="http://awards.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web 2007 Awards</a> show. The whole experience was great, especially because I got to accept an award that was actually destined for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Jimbo, apparently, could not make it to the show, so they picked the next best guy, <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20252-1/531238157_a8d31ee66d_b.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[87]">me</a> (make sure to click on that link, it really is worth it!).</p>
<p>After a great Awards show, the real after-party started, but I will let <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/thenextweb_07/">the photographs</a> speak for themselves.</p>
<p>All in all, <em>The Next Web 2007</em> was as great as the 2006 edition, if not even greater. I learned a lot, met a lot of interesting people and had an awesome time.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations Boris (and crew) for managing to set up something as kick-ass as this.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on June 8th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Just like the first edition of The Next Web conference, this year also provided an area for up-and-coming start-ups. The team of the conference selects a group of companies and or people who get to showcase their product during breaks.</p>
<p>Unlike last year, the 2007 edition of the conference was held at the beautiful Tushinski Theater in Amsterdam. While the venue in itself is a great spot for conferences and provided great seating for everyone, the start-up arena had to suffer from one problem: too little space.</p>
<p>In 2006, the venue had multiple stories and all stands had ample room to set up shop and present their products, this year, start-ups had to stand back to back with competitors. Not really a problem for visitors, but probably annoying for the companies that hoped to get a great spot.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the start-ups I saw had some interesting ideas. All the stands I visited seemed to be doing one thing or another with crowds and that special community feeling.</p>
<p>The first start-up I saw was tipit.to. The site basically provides a way to compensate artists, bloggers, charities and others for the work they do. The idea behind the system is simple: you pledge to donate a certain amount of money and once the pot reaches a certain limit, the person / charity that is eligible for the donation gets it. tipit.to doesn‚Äôt charge commission and they hope to get you to sign up by relying on micro-payments. The site most certainly is capable of processing huge payments, but the real idea is that many small contributions also can make a difference. On a sidenote: this site is not a substitute for services like PayPerPost that pay people to blog about a product in a very distinct manner. tipit.to has no affiliation with manufacturers that I know of.</p>
<p>The second start-up I saw was Respectance. If I were to describe it in one sentence I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs a mashup between Flickr, YouTube, TypePad and an active community. The idea is simple. Your direct environment will get fed up fairly quick when you ‚Äústill‚Äù have to cope with the death of someone close to you for more than a couple of weeks. Respectance.com provides you with an outlet for your feelings. The site let‚Äôs you create a kind of profile for the person (hey, what about pets?) you lost and you want to remember. Sure, you could do the same with YouTube and Flickr, but then again, those sites aren‚Äôt really the environment you are looking for when you want to remember someone as good as possible. You don‚Äôt want to be looking at a clip of your passed-away grandmother and be greeted with a few childish comments from those who haven‚Äôt had a chance at experiencing the sorrow you are going through. While talking about the idea during the The Next Web Dinner party, someone mentioned that the site was like a remix between scientology and Flickr but I‚Äôd have to disagree. For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôd much rather see people upload their videos to a site I won‚Äôt accidentally come across when I‚Äôm looking for home-made entertainment in the form of short video clips. This way, the users of YouTube won‚Äôt disrespect the death of a person and those that have to learn to live with their loss, have a community of supportive voices.</p>
<p>The third and last start-up I went to was Wakoopa, Boris‚Äô newest project. In simple terms, Wakoopa is the last.fm of software tracking. The site provides users with a client that tracks how long you use any given application and lets you view stats about the software habits of your friends too. Too really monetize the content of the site, developers can get a special (for pay) account that lets them track how people use their application, when said application is used, how long it is used. Think of it as Urchin Analytics meets last.fm. Simple concept, good idea and you can even select which applications should or should not be listed on your profile.</p>
<p>All in all, it‚Äôs great to see that companies in and around Europe were able to come up with interesting and good ideas over the past year and I wish all of the start-ups best of luck for the future.</p>
