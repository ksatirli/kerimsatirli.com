	<div class="main">
		<p>If there is one thing that I hate, it is most probably getting up early. It is not like I <em>can not</em> get up early, it is just that I have a strong dislike against getting up early.</p>
<p>I am not lazy, but rather nocturnal and a big part of my creative cycle revolves around the late (and sometimes: early) hours of the day.</p>
<p>Some people have suggested that being nocturnal, as far as humans go, is a conditioned behavior and even though I partially agree, I do not care enough to actually change my set way of operating, not unless I absolutely have to.</p>
<p>Having to get up at 5 am (!) to prepare for a set-call at 7 am some 60 miles away from where you actually slept, in my book, qualifies as one of these situations where deviating from your normal way of doing things is acceptable.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, Wiendelt invited me to take part in a shoot for the CliniClowns&#8217; show <a href="http://www.neuzenroode.nl/">Neuzenroode</a>, where I acted as the boom-mic operator.</p>
<p>Not even five days later, I got another chance at joining both Wiendelt and GabeB (our resident singer-songwriter) for a shoot comissioned by the <a href="http://www.nisb.nl/" title="Nederlands Instituut voor Sport en Beweging">NISB</a>, and that is where the story began.</p>
<p>The shoot was split into two days, Monday was in Maassluis, Wednesday was in Zwolle, both locations being a fair distance from Amsterdam meant getting up early, very early, namely <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/internship_xolo/IMG_0587.JPG.html">during a time</a> when every sane person is actually sleeping.</p>
<p>Still, the morning started off nicely with a fairly sized bowl of cereals and the Foo Fighters&#8217; <em>Times Like These</em> playing on the radio, I already knew that the day would turn out to be good, and it would. I am going to spare you the details, but shooting can be quite entertaining, especially if you have company that can make it worth your while.</p>
<p>Apart from having a great day, I also learned a valuable lesson: cables are never long enough for the task you need them, yet always long enough to get in the way, which can be quite annoying when you have someone moving around your boom-mic all the time and stepping on the cable (I figured out a simple way of solving the problem with the help of a keychain and some ducttape).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this entry, the only thing left to say is: thanks Wiendelt and GabeB for inviting me and a very big thank you to GabeB for hooking me up with a place to crash, thereby actually making it possible for me to join the team during the shoot.</p>

		<p>I realize that I have been talking about my involvement with <a href="http://xolo.tv/">xolo.tv</a> for some time now, but I always forgot to <em>really</em> show people what it is that we do. Well, fret not, I am not going to show you, right now, but I am going to share something special with you.</p>
<p>All you have to do is (left) click on <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/kerimsatirli/blog/intern_report_5/xolo_team.flv.html" title="xolo.tv - meet the team" >this link</a> and a new window will open with the video in it.</p>
<p>A note of advice: the clip is roughly 17mb in size, so you might not want to do this on a mobile connection unless you really <em>are</em> dying get to know the team.</p>

		<p>It has been something close to four weeks now since my last intern report and while I initially planned to make this a weekly returning series, it turns out that working fulltime can do weird things to your scheduling as well as your stamina. One of those things is that, after a full day, I sometimes feel so spent that I simply cannot bring myself to write something that is actually worth posting and often just end up scrapping the whole piece.</p>
<p>Lucky me, xolo.tv has what could be considered an implementation of the Google Labs idea, where you get to spend 20% of your work time on personal projects; with the biggest difference being that, at xolo.tv, I <em>actually</em> get to choose what I want to work on, while Google limits your freedom to something that may be used to expand the company&#8217;s product portfolio.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I find myself spending most of my time with treks through the intricacies of ExpressionEngine, which is finding more and more support here every day; if not only for the fact that the system, excuse the strong language here, damn flexible, that we have not yet been able to come up with a problem that cannot be tackled with it.</p>
<p>Apart from my techy backend work, I have also forayed into the area of frontend development and am actually starting the first phase of a huge project this week. Once phase one is completed, I will make sure to post about it here, suffice to say that the project is bigger than most of the &#8216;jobs I have done in the past and combines a great number of different techniques to form a solution that delivers content across a large scale of mediums, yet is able to target highly specific needs.</p>
<p>While, technically speaking, the project should be considered &#8220;work&#8221;, I perceive it much more as a reward given to me by the powers that be; the reward itself stemming from work I completed earlier on, where I proved that I could carry my load and come up with solutions that, most of the time, <em>simply worked</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, my <a href="http://mindcaster.typepad.com/">direct boss</a> was (and hopefully: still is) so happy about my work, that he decided  to give me a recommendation on LinkedIn:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/25021-1/linkedin-recommendation.png" alt="LinkedIn: recommendation from Marc van Woudenberg" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a related note: it still feels weird to think of someone as my boss. In my short time <em>in the field</em>, I have always been independent. Yes, I have worked with others and yes, I have had clients that required reporting, but I never had a real boss. It is an interesting setting indeed…</p>
<p>As if a recommendation on LinkedIn was not enough, Gabriel Bauer, our resident movie-shooting-director-turned-producer-and-what-not dedicated a whole song to me (well, me and the two other IT guys) and the guy has got talent too (beware, the clip comes in at a hefty 25mb):</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../c/blog/college/internships/index.html" title="View all posts in Internships" rel="category tag">Internships</a> on February 8th, 2008 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>It has been a tad more than a week now, since my last <em>intern report</em> and I am finally finding some time to actually post something here.</p>
<p>The past few days have been busy; we have been doing a whole lot of testing, evaluating and fine tuning of one of the core components , but it is safe to say that the solution we came up with is working as expected, in fact, it is working so good that we are undershooting the projected and optimized reference values by anything between 16 and 25 per cent, <em>hoah!</em> to that.</p>
<p>Besides testing, we have also moved forward with a number of web-development related projects and I managed to convince my superiors to make use of <a href="http://www.expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>, one of the web&#8217;s most powerful CMS as far as I know.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I posted on the <a href="../../blog/college/team-dynamics-and-the-lack-thereof/index.html">topic of team dynamics</a> and how important they are for the well-functioning of a group of people that are supposed to work together and now, after three weeks of working at <em>xolo.tv</em>, I can safely conclude that this team has an awesome flow.</p>
<p>Yes, even good teams have those moments where individual members get a tad cranky, but like in every good relationship, it is way better to talk about the things that annoy you than to keep them to yourself and, finally, erupt like a volcano and most probably damaging a relationship (for good).</p>
<p>It is also interesting to see that humans are not unlike dogs, <ins datetime="2008-02-08T10:53:41+00:00">at least</ins> in the way they approach each other: the first few days, I had the feeling that we were mainly trying to figure out what my position would be exactly, kind of like a group of dogs sniffing each other out and deciding if the other is a threat or an ally.</p>
<p>So far, I have not been bitten, so I figure <a href="http://www.xolo.tv">they</a> do not consider me hostile and judging by the stuff I get to do, I am actually getting the feeling that they are starting to warm up to me. And &#8230; let me tell you, it feels good to be appreciated, because that makes you want to perform even better, impress the others even more.</p>

		<h2 id="post-177"><a href="../../2008/01/31/intern-report-2-this-is-what-i-do/index.html" rel="bookmark">Intern Report #2 (This is what I do)</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../c/blog/college/internships/index.html" title="View all posts in Internships" rel="category tag">Internships</a> on January 31st, 2008 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>When I first pitched the idea of me doing my internship at <a href="http://www.xolo.tv/">xolo.tv</a>, I was offered a chance that few interns get: I could pick my own project. Now, you have to understand that my <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a> has some guidelines as to what an intern should do, but technically speaking, everything that <em>xolo.tv</em> had available, fell within those guidelines and I had <em>carte blanche</em>.</p>
<p>In the past years, I have learned that having <em>cojones</em> is one of the main ingredients that you need if you plan on making a difference and that, dear reader, is something I want(ed) to do at <em>xolo.tv</em>, to make a difference.</p>
<p>At a highly dynamic company like this, with a high output of deliverables, finding something that actually makes a difference can be rather difficult, unless you are foolish enough to propose to deliver a solution that works faster (in terms of time), costs less (in terms of usage) and offers a more customized feature package; the fact that this solution is one of the core components of the <em>xolo.tv</em> platform is just additional icing on the cake.</p>
<p>What it is exactly that I am doing is something I cannot tell you, due to an NDA I signed, suffice to say that it is important, interesting and even innovative.</p>
<p>While we gear up for the release, you might want to check out a few of the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/internship_xolo/">pictures</a> we took &#8216;around the office.</p>
<p>Being offered a chance to work on something like this is, simply put, <em>freakin&#8217; awesome</em> and very educative at the same time and I figure that the best way to finish this report is by giving you something to think about:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ain&#8217;t nothing like a man that can do what he wanna&#8230;</p></blockquote>
