		<description>It hits home far greater when you least expect it. A great majority of people that WOULD pick up complete strangers, hitchhikers and the likes, have been abused or taken advantage of, or had bad experiences. Its a shame, because there are so many GENUINLY good people out there that would randomly do stuff like that.
Genuine kind people that wander like this person here, where a random kind act brightens theyre day, and makes them feel better about life in general, dont see this because of all the other people out theyre that destroy these "givers-of-kind-acts". Society in a nutshell has changed from what it used to be. The old-world (Europe/Eastern, has turned into an americanized War-machine, with so many kind-hearted people being hurt psychologically, and physically.
Its all a viscious cycle. Think about this the next time you see someone hitchhiking, or walking in the rain alone, or even someone looking down on theyre luck. No matter how bad or depressed you think your life may be, as important as yours is, someone else somewhere else, has it worse off.</description>
