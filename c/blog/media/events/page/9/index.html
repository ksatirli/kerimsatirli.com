		<p>On June 1st, the European internet community converged onto Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to meet up for a conference that just could.</p>
<p>Before we start out with an in-depth dissection of the day, let me quickly brush over the whom, what and where:</p>
<p>Close to a year ago, Dutch serial entrepreneur <a href="http://www.bomega.com/">Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten</a> invited people to join him at, what I believe is the only European Web 2.0 conference that matters.</p>
<p>While the setting was fairly personal, it didn&#8217;t feel uncomfortable. With an array of interesting speakers, startups and venture capitalists, Boris managed to bring together what Europe was longing for: a great setting to be inspired and inspire, to network and socialize.</p>
<p>In fact, &#8220;The Next Web 2006&#8243; turned out to be such a great success that the second edition of the event was announced a day later, while most people were still recovering from the effects of the after party.</p>
<p>The following entries will be part recap and part personal opinion. I&#8217;m doing this out of my own free will and decided that those who couldn&#8217;t attend the conference should at least get a chance to read about it.</p>

		<p>Nearly eleven months ago, <a href="http://www.bomega.com/">Boris Veldhuizen van Zanten </a> graced the European Internet community with the first edition of <a href="http://www.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web</a> conference.</p>
<p>Not unlike American Web 2.0 conferences, <em>The Next Web</em> aims to bring together the top influencers with those who are interested in expanding their knowledge and be inspired by some of the awesome success stories.</p>
<p>This years edition, which will start in about nine hours, will feature such <a href="http://2007.thenextweb.org/speakers/">great speakers</a> as <a href="http://www.deborahschultz.com/">Deborah Schultz</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">Michael Arrington</a> and my personal favourite: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Hardt">Dick Hardt</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be attending with two colleagues of mine, namely <a href="http://marckohlbrugge.com/blog">Marc</a> and Joep.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite certain that there will be WiFi coverage, so I&#8217;ll try to blog as much during the conference as possible. For now, though, it&#8217;s time to pack my stuff and get ready.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>Ever so often, a group of teachers at my <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a> organize a day-long<br />
event that&#8217;s supposed to be all about gaining theoretical knowledge. Few people are looking forward to these days and quite a few students actually &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of even attending the sessions.</p>
<p>A week ago, we had another one of these events, this one, geared towards <em>Serious Gaming</em> and all the things related to creating serious games.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest about this, up front, I didn&#8217;t feel like the event would provide much interesting stuff, if any at all. We had one of these &#8220;Theory Events&#8221; back in the first quarter of this year and the general consensus was that it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>People didn&#8217;t dislike the event based on the idea of the event, but rather on the actual execution of the event. When I attend a class, hearing, discussion panel or anything, I am there for a reason, I want to expand my knowledge. Other than talking about a few Dutch Blogs and trying to explain the concept of Dot Walking to a couple hundred students, the speaker didn&#8217;t do much at all.</p>
<p>Most of us had never heard of Dot Walking and normally, this would have been enough to spark an interesting discussion, however, the whole idea didn&#8217;t offer <em>anything</em> related to our project at all. For my part, a flash mob would have carried more educational value but alas.</p>
<p>So, with the bad taste from the first even still clinging to the back of my mouth, I went to attend the second Theory Event of my sophomore year:</p>
<p>The day was split into three (or four) parts. First, we&#8217;d get to hear a keynote from Annet Dekker, who works at <a href="http://www.montevideo.nl/">Montevideo</a>, an organization that specializes in creating <em>time based arts</em>.</p>
<p>The whole speech was more or less a showcase of her own work, mixed with work that her company created. Ever so often, a short video clip would be used to make it easier for us to visualize her creations. While she did offer some valid points, I found it a tad annoying that she limited her presentation by only selecting stuff she created.</p>
<p>It is natural for people to be proud of what they achieved, however, if your whole keynote only relates to your own products, you&#8217;re lacking perspective and that makes you appear a lot more biased than you probably are.</p>
<p>After a short break, we were treated to a movie called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXistenZ">eXistenZ</a>. Released in the same year as <em>The Matrix</em>, the movie tells a similar but not identical story.</p>
<p>In both movies, people use <em>ports</em> in their bodies to link themselves to a system that operates solely on a metaphysical level, but that&#8217;s where the similarities end.</p>
<p>eXistenZ is about a game, a game that is so real that players can&#8217;t tell if they are still playing it or not. Playing might actually not be the right word in this case, it&#8217;s more of an experience than pure entertainment.</p>
<p>The participants don&#8217;t just passively enjoy the offerings of the system, they actually are part of the (mostly linear) story.</p>
<p>The movie was great and I certainly enjoyed watching it, mostly because the ideas portrayed within the movie become less and less of a probability and more and more of a reality.</p>
<p>The ideas also kinda remind me of &#8220;<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=nA4TKAJKTwk">Counter-Struck</a>&#8220;, a parody of the well known game Counter-Strike. The director of the movie, a fellow crossmedia engineering student, tells the story of a player who immerses himself that much in the game, that the game starts <em>happening</em> around the player.</p>
<p>After another short break, Daniël van Gils, chief-creative-guy at <a href="http://www.kamerblauwlicht.nl/">KamerBlauwLicht</a> showcased a few great Machinima movies (some even unknown to me) and tried to riddle us with the following questions:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Is gaming art?</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>can games be used to create art</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>This was probably the most memorable part of the whole day, most certainly because I&#8217;m working on my own movie and have a strong opinion about this:</p>
<p>Van Gils appears to be a strong supporter of Machinima and he seems to be fascinated by it. He went as far as creating a mod for the Doom III engine that would allow him to create a live performance that was inspired by the music playing around him.</p>
<p>This really shows how committed this person really is towards Machinima and I have to applaud him for embracing such a new form of art in such an extensive way. Especially since most people don&#8217;t even know what Machinima really is and what it can be used for.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of years ago, cave paintings were the first form of art that humans created. Today, if you&#8217;re able to acquire a piece with a real cave painting on it, you probably would be holding not only a piece of history, but also a piece of significant monetary value in your hands.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is that, over the millenia, art has evolved. From the cave paintings to the Mona Lisa, from the first sketches of Aristoteles to the Wrapped Reichstag, art has been evolving and <em>still</em> is.</p>
<p>A few decades ago, graffitti wasn&#8217;t considered art, but today it is. Sure, it hasn&#8217;t yet reached the same level of acceptance oil paintings have, but that is mostly because oil paintings have been around much longer.</p>
<p>A few years from now, Machinima will have gained a much larger following. In recent months, the barrier for entering this genre has been lowered quite a bit. Editing tools, for both video and audio, have become a lot more accessible and many different kinds are available, catering to novice users as well as professionals alike.</p>
<p>More and more companies are embracing Machinima as valid forms of marketing. Not just because it offers a low-cost alternative to expensive CG graphics, but also because it has more of an amateuristic factor to it, something that can often work in favor of the director.</p>
<p>All in all, this event was a lot more interesting than the first one and provided me with the questions I was looking for. The sessions made me think, made me discuss and made me talk about the ideas that were presented to us and that&#8217;s all I want.</p>

		<h2 id="post-73"><a href="../../../../../../2007/03/02/next-night-20/index.html" rel="bookmark">Next Night 2.0</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../college/index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on March 2nd, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>This past Tuesday, <a href="http://www.generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a> organized the second evening in their, so far, successful, series of events called &#8220;Next Night&#8221;. The idea behind these events is to bring (CMD) students in touch with market influencer as well as innovation leaders and academic researchers, thereby creating an intriguing evening loaded with useful information. The best thing is that it&#8217;s limited to a small group of people and so far, I&#8217;ve only seen people who <strong>really</strong> wanted to be there.</p>
<p>The evening was kicked off by Barend Raaff from <a href="http://www.dnbmedia.com/">DNB Media</a>. The speech contained some interesting questions - for example in regards of the latest events that are happening in Second Life and who should be held accountable for them:</p>
<p>Mr. Raaff likes to think of Second Life as a means of communication, not unlike the phone system operated by KPN or Ma Bell. He goes on to explain that the medium cannot be blamed for the things some, misguided users do with it.</p>
<p>This week, two nuclear missiles were <a href="http://www.dutchcowboys.nl/online/9572/">exploded</a> in Second Life. The objective behind this mission that was spearheaded by the Second Life Liberation Army (SLLA) is to make Linden Labs, the developers of the game, aware to the fact that users want to more control over the Sims (the gaming environments) and that they won&#8217;t refrain from taking game altering actions.</p>
<p>The type of bomb that was used can be acquired in-game and their effect is nearly as devastating as in real life. The explosions consume so much CPU power that the servers just shut down. With 2700 Second Life servers out there, one would think that two servers wouldn&#8217;t matter, but unfortunately they do. Every time, someone sets off a bomb and kills a server, there is a 25% chance that the server that crashes will take another server with it. This percentage increases by one point with every server that gets killed successfully.</p>
<p>The shutdown also means that any data that wasn&#8217;t saved might be lost, which could incur real-world economical ramifications, because, after all, the Second Life currency known as Linden Dollars has to be acquired by real world money. On that topic, Mr. Raaff also noted that he doesn&#8217;t (yet) consider Linden Dollars to be a threat to actual real-world currency.</p>
<p>The second speaker was Bas van Ulden, head of the Second Life team of <a href="http://www.abnamro.nl/">ABN AMRO</a>, a well known financial institution. His team managed to create an online presence inside Second Life, thereby earning his team the title of &#8220;First European bank in Second Life&#8221;. Quite a feat, especially if you consider that most of the team didn&#8217;t use Second Life before and they managed to build the whole thing in a mere eight weeks.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that ABN AMRO bought 32 sims, however, only six or seven are currently in use and by summer 2007, another ten sims will be made accessible to the general public. I&#8217;m curious as to what they have in store for their customers.</p>
<p>I think their approach, so far, is unique. They are the first European bank I know off that let&#8217;s you &#8220;skype&#8221; with your account manager (as opposed to calling an expensive phone number) as well as check your account balance via <a href="../../../../../../tech-talk/guides/geeky-tools-you-will-want-to-use/index.html">MSN Messenger</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, the decision to start out in Second Life was entirely business based, after all, the Netherlands are home to the biggest non-English community on Second Life.  However, you can tell that this bank really values the social aspect of the Internet and Mr. Ulden&#8217;s speech was probably the best of the whole evening. Not because it offered possible employment opportunities to anyone interested and qualified, but rather because he was very open about the whole experience. He didn&#8217;t refrain from telling us how much they did wrong and how they had to learn the hard way.</p>
<p>I value his honesty and I think it tells a lot about how he and his small team of ten thinks of the net community.</p>
<p>The keynote was concluded by some statistics which gave some insight into the success of the whole operation. It turned out that ABN AMRO gets about 500 to 600 visitors a week in all their Sims combined and even though they only cater to the Dutch market right now, they get the occasional foreign visitor too.</p>
<p>After a short break, Raymond van der Kaaij from <a href="http://www.lostinthemagicforest.com/">(lost in the) Magic Forest</a> kicked off the second half of the evening by sharing some insight into the hows and whats of marketing in Second Life. For example, if you want to expand your base of operations into Second Life, you should ask yourself how you can do that in a way that links up with your offline brand. It is important to know how you can add value to the experience of the visitor and how you can turn them into recurring visitors.</p>
<p>Mr. van der Kaaij also believes the &#8220;whole thing&#8221; to be about experience design: &#8220;If there&#8217;s no experience then there&#8217;s no unique selling point and that&#8217;s when you should stop considering Second Life as a base of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>David de Nood from <a href="http://www.epn.net/">EPN</a> concluded the evening by explaining how Second Life was a game without a set ending point, but far from pointless. He also shared some very interesting stats with us. It turns out that from the group of heavy users, that is, people that play approximately ten to forty hours a week, more than half is female. What&#8217;s even more interesting is that this group is between 25 and 40 years old and has at least completed college. Most of them have creative jobs in the IT or marketing sector.</p>
<p>Even though this group plays an average of 25 hours a week, only 40% of the members consider themselves addicted to the game. The main reason, according to Mr. de Nood is, that the psycho-social wellbeing in-game, is a lot higher than outside, in the real world. It&#8217;s easier to establish contacts because there&#8217;s some sense of anonymity. EPN&#8217;s research also predicts that more businesses (especially those with goods related to Second Life) will open up to payments made in Linden Dollars.</p>
<p>The evening was concluded with an informal discussion where all of the speakers actively took part in. Thanks a lot to Marc and Noortje and the other members from <a href="http://www.generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a> for setting up this meeting. Congratulations on a job well done. I&#8217;m already looking forward to see what you guys can come up with for Next Night 3.0!</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on February 9th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p><a href="http://www.fokjou.nl/">Marc</a> just reminded me of a clip that the guys from <a href="http://www.molblog.nl/">molbog</a> shot during the awesome &#8220;<a href="http://www.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web</a>&#8221; Conference, which was held in Amsterdam last July.</p>
<p>In the video, the interviewer asks people what their definition of the next web is. The camera guy sadly didn&#8217;t have access to a silent recording environment, so you&#8217;ll probably have to watch this clip at least twice to be able to understand all the things people say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the clip too, discussing what I think the next web is and will be. Funnily enough, my visions of what the web links up very nicely with what <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/">Steven Pemberton</a> (of <a href="http://w3c.org/">W3C</a> fame) had to say.</p>
<p>So, without further ado - I give you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igvx00ms6MM">the clip</a> and before you ask, no, I have no clue as to what I was on that caused my excessive movement&#8230;</p>
