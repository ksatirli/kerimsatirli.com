	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../c/blog/media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on March 19th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>A bit more than a year ago, a famous Dutch <a href="http://www.nrc.nl/">newspaper</a>, primarily aimed at the group of people with higher education, went forward with an idea to attract a new group of readers, namely the myriad of young professionals who didn&#8217;t have the time to read the full story behind events and only wanted a bit more than a blurb.</p>
<p>The publisher came up with a way to, basically, spoon feed information to their prospective, future clients and they called it <a href="http://www.nrc.nl/next/">NRC.next</a>. The journalists like to think of their publication as a way to get up-to-date on what has happened in the world in the fastest way possible.</p>
<p>Now, a newspaper on it&#8217;s own wouldn&#8217;t really be worth the time to talk about, but NRC.next is different. They are one of the first Dutch newspaper to embrace crossmedia publishing and embrace it the right way.</p>
<p>Apart from the actual, printed, publication, there&#8217;s the online edition, with additional information. Many of the journalists also contribute to a platform that could actually be considered a blog. NRC.next even toyed with the idea of publishing podcasts but it would appear that that step was just a bit too much.</p>
<p>The best thing? Half of the web-based content is freely available to everyone, either via the browser or through a RSS subscription.</p>
<p>The resulting numbers speak for themselves, after one year, they are still standing strong, In a market that is very highly saturated, they managed to gain a foothold and attract an audience that normally wouldn&#8217;t bother reading newspapers due to time constraints or the lack of interest.</p>
<p>The newspapers distribution time is also different to that of it&#8217;s parent&#8217;s. While NRC Handelsblad is published in the evening, targeted at decisionmakers who want to relax after a long day at work and spend some quality time with the latest news, NRC.next is published in the morning and is supposed to be on your doorstep at 07:00am.</p>
<p>The idea behind that is simple, I figure: &#8220;if you&#8217;re the first to bring news to your reader, you win (and get paid, eventually)&#8221;, And it makes sense, if your client has a chance to get his news somewhere else, say, on the web, for free, there&#8217;s no incentive left to actually buy your publication.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t read NRC.next regularly, I&#8217;ve still been able to enjoy the newspaper for quite some time now and in fact still have the first issue at home. As a reader of the first hour, I have to say that this publication manages to amaze in ways previously unseen, in the Netherlands anyway.</p>
<p>So here is to you, you editors, you journalists, you bloggers, all of you who make NRC.next the great thing that it has become. I compliment you on a job well done. You&#8217;ve managed to amaze the (Dutch) publishing world, for a year already, don&#8217;t stop now.</p>
<p>As one wuld expect from a market leader in (publishing) innovation, NRC.next also gifted it&#8217;s readers with something very special: a 14 track CD.</p>
<p>The songs are a compilation from tracks published my favorite, online, music publisher <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> as well as from <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/">jamendo.com</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to these tracks while writing this post and, like the newspaper, the featured songs are of high quality. The listing is very diverse, however, it doesn&#8217;t try to cater to all wishes at the same time but rather present the listeners with new music they probably haven&#8217;t heard before.</p>
<p>The whole album, free of charge, is available via <a href="http://www.nrcext.nl/?action=1jaar">this link</a>, cover art and all is, naturally, included.</p>

		<h2 id="post-53"><a href="../../2007/01/14/how-to-sell-digital-music-101/index.html" rel="bookmark">How to sell digital music 101</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../c/blog/media/marketing/index.html" title="View all posts in Marketing" rel="category tag">Marketing</a> on January 14th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Whenever you read news from the entertainment industry, you hear C - level staff complaining about how bad digital music is hurting sales and how hard it is to sell music to people because everyone just pirates it, you&#8217;ve heard those for years now, you&#8217;ll keep hearing them for quite some time more.</p>
<p>Sure, there&#8217;s Apple and the iTMS, which is doing quite well - because there are lots of iPods out there and people are easily tricked into buying more than one song ( &#8220;come on mom, it&#8217;s only a buck!&#8221; ). The whole store is doing well, in fact, a lot better than the top 10 stores that sell DRM-secured Windows Media Audio files together, but there are still those that dislike how Apple handles DRM.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t feel like getting into the whole DRM discussion more than I have to, mostly because I&#8217;m no expert on it, but from personal experience I know that certain DRM schemes are hurting the customers and put them off.</p>
<p>For example, my ISP provides those that subscribe to one of the better packages with credits for their (WMA-powered) online music store. You don&#8217;t pay for it 1:1, it&#8217;s all included in your subscription. A nice idea, it keeps people from downloading pirated music &#8230; or does it?</p>
<p>In the past, I&#8217;d &#8220;buy&#8221; my albums at the store, then proceed to a P2P site to download the MP3s, including coverart and intelligently named files (rather than &#8220;artistid_tracknumber_trackname.wma&#8221;). Technically speaking, I didn&#8217;t do anything bad, I didn&#8217;t share those MP3s with anyone and I was able to listen to them on the device of my choosing (I have / had quite a few devices and I dislike the idea of losing 50% of my media library because of device lock-in). I didn&#8217;t even bother downloading the WMA-encrypted files, why waste bandwidth after all?</p>
<p>So, you won&#8217;t believe how happy I was when I first discovered the goodness that is <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">MagnaTune</a>. Sure, they haven&#8217;t signed any uber-famous acts like Britney Spears or Robbie Williams (who&#8217;d want them anyway?), but that doesn&#8217;t mean that any of their artists aren&#8217;t great musicians. All of the performers are screened and the team from MagnaTune then decides who actually gets to be included in their portfolio.</p>
<p>While that is a a good feature on it&#8217;s own, here&#8217;s what I really love about them: when you buy a CD, you get to decide how much you pay for it. Say, if you&#8217;re short on cash, you could spend a couple bucks, burn that CD, then impress your girlfriend with it while you propose to her. She accepts and you&#8217;re so thankful that you decided to buy the CD again and now pay a bigger amount. Granted, I&#8217;m quite sure this hasn&#8217;t happened (yet), but it&#8217;s one way to describe their pricing policies.</p>
<p>When you buy a CD, it&#8217;s up to you how you want it. There are quite a few different formats, high and higher bitrate MP3, FLAC, WAV, everything really. And if you happen to lose your music along the road, you just hit up their re-download form and you&#8217;ll get a mail with all your music downloads again, at no extra charge, naturally.</p>
<p>Another thing I love is that with every album you purchase, you get three tickets to give away to friends. They can then download the same album you bought for free. Sure, you <em>could</em> send out more tickets, but then again, why hurt those that try to please you?</p>
<p>Like every good web-based company, they have a <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/">blog</a> available, with lots of great information, should you be looking for more reading. Oh, and they&#8217;re working on a <a href="http://london.redmood.com/blog/2007/01/under_construct.html">Second Life space</a> too.</p>
<p>Another company that just gets it is <a href="http://www.candyrat.com/">CANDdYRAT Records</a>. Like MagnaTune, they have a nice selection of artists in their line up. They approach marketing in an innovative way, if you ask me. I am, like most people, too busy to go out and look for music, I&#8217;d much rather get a list of suggestions (just like <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> and <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> do) and then take my pick.</p>
<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been using YouTube to discover new music and came across a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn4MGaS3N4">great clip</a> called Drifting from Andy McKee. The whole clip is available on YouTube and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=rpoland">the user</a> that uploaded it, who actually is the owner of CANdYRAT Records, had another 44 videos available for my entertainment.</p>
<p>I was so fascinated by the Andy McKee stuff that I kept watching clip after clip. His music sounds great, but I&#8217;m quite sure I wouldn&#8217;t have bought it if I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten a chance to see the guy in action. Thanks to the use of some innovative marketing of his assets, Mr. R. Poland managed to turn a listener into a customer and so I decided to order my very own copy of the &#8220;Art of Motion&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ordering the CD didn&#8217;t go down without a hitch though, the first time I tried, Paypal asked me for a credit card, even though I had enough funds in my account to cover it. After asking for some assistance from CANdYRAT Records, I was quickly presented with alternate solutions. In the end, I tried again with Paypal a day later and it just worked. During the whole order process, I received quick replies to emails whenever I had a question and was finally told that my order would arrive in 7 to 10 business days.</p>
<p>Well, what do you know - 2 business days (not counting Saturday, where postal service is, technically speaking available) later, I received a small package with <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/15987-2/IMG_2170.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[53]">the CD</a> I longed for.</p>
<p>With both companies, support has been great. I wasn&#8217;t hassled by any DRM-schemes, I received personal support whenever I had questions and paying for the media was easy too. So if you&#8217;re looking to expand your media library, have a look at both <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">MagnaTune</a> and <a href="http://www.candyrat.com/">CANdYRAT Records</a>, maybe you&#8217;ll find your new favorite artist(s) there&#8230;</p>
