	<div class="main">
		<p>Let’s be honest, TV as a single medium is dead. No TV station with more than 5k viewers nowadays can afford to only provide it’s viewers with one means of access to its content.</p>
<p>Thanks to recent advances in technology, it has become very easy for people to turn into guerilla filmmakers and there has been an explosive grow of content. Nowadays, just about everyone can create just about everything. While the quality of such user-generated content might not be on-par with what the “big guys” are producing, this development certainly shows that consumers don’t want to just sit down and have the TV channel hit them with their “fix”, no, users are looking to take part in the whole process.</p>
<p>While the situation in Europe isn’t as advanced as in the United States, TV channels have done a great job in providing users with more means to interact with what’s happening on screen. During casting shows, viewers are able to vote for their favourite up-and-coming-star and for certain TV shows, consumers can even receive up to the minute information as to when a given show really starts.</p>
<p>Sadly, all these “enhancements” are actually ways to generate more revenue and provide little added service for the viewer. Compared to what consumers in the US of A are able to receive, this development looks like TV channels in Europe are only slightly past the stone age.</p>
<p>“Companion” was, according to me, the buzzword of the years 2005 and 2006 in media that was broadcast in recent years. Viewers expect to receive more “bang for their buck” so to speak and the bigger media networks are more than happy to oblige:</p>
<p>CBS’ new hit show “Jericho” for example is available for free on InnerTube, via a streaming Flash Player. The show’s web companions “Beyond Jericho” and “Countdown” provide extra information about the story. While they don’t feature the same characters, fans are given an extra five minutes of their favourite show every week.</p>
<p>The SciFi channel approaches the problem from a different point of view: it’s hit series Stargate: SG1 and Stargate: Atlantis are both accompanied by about five weblogs each, written by the show’s producers, actors and other staff. During the first three shows of the last three seasons, SciFi even released podcasts that provided additional commentary to the story on screen.</p>
<p>These channels have seen the light, they know that they can’t beat the Internet’s power, so they decided to harness it in the best way possible. The result? Stargate: SG1 has seen a 15% increase in viewers over the last three years, which is amazing for a show that has been running for close to ten years now.</p>
<p>Sure, in the end, all these networks want is more viewers so they can sell more airtime to their advertisers, but the deal offered to the consumer is a good one.</p>

		<p>A week or so ago, I blogged about my movie project and about it&#8217;s possible premiere on Friday, February 2nd. Obviously, there was no premiere, yet, because of a few events that happened.</p>
<p>For one, the affiliation with the team that builds <a href="http://usi.jarhedz.com/">US: I</a> is working out very nicely and they are catering for most of my wishes. In return I&#8217;m rewriting scenes to better fit their environments, not just because I feel obliged to, but also because it&#8217;s a lot easier to showcase their stuff that way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also rewriting dialogue based on new research I discovered, to make certain scenes more realistic and to add a few more easter eggs. I&#8217;ve also been working on a movie poster (actually, I&#8217;ve been working on three different ones) and I&#8217;m revising my marketing strategy for the whole project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scottsigler.net/">Scott</a> is doing a great job as a voice actor and so are the other people. I have a lot of new found respect for movie makers, young and old. This project is <em>a lot</em> bigger than originally expected, but still, it&#8217;s a great experience and I would do it again any time.</p>
<p>More (elaborate) updates will follow soon.</p>

		<h2 id="post-55"><a href="../../../../../2007/01/30/its-all-about-the-research/index.html" rel="bookmark">It&#8217;s all about the research</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../projects/index.html" title="View all posts in Projects" rel="category tag">Projects</a> on January 30th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>When I first started drafting scenes for my movie project, I decided that I wanted this project to be as intensive and educational as a standard college project. I wanted to have the feeling that it wasn&#8217;t just a fun thing to do, I wanted to learn something, I wanted to expand my knowledge in ways that would later benefit me, both personally as well as professionally.</p>
<p>I started out with a basic planning that included the various steps. First of all, to write a credible story, I had to get a better understanding of the way people &#8220;down there&#8221; think. What might be totally acceptable to us (think: revealing clothes worn by females) is totally unacceptable in other cultures. Sure, I <em>did</em> know that much, but all the knowledge I had, prior to getting accustomed to the culture, wasn&#8217;t nearly enough.</p>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;m a westerner, my target audience are westerners, but there&#8217;s such a thing as sticking to the facts and even though it was going to be a fictitious story, I wanted every aspect of it to be as real as possible. Every last piece of information I gathered had to be able to withstand scrutiny.</p>
<p>Local movies are a great way to get to know a culture better, but it&#8217;s hard to find the right kind of movie. There are lots and lots of televised stories out there that label themselves &#8220;local&#8221; but many of them are actually made to appeal to a broad, western-oriented audience. Well, long story short - I found a couple of movies, most of them lacking good subtitles (not to say there were no subtitles available, but the quality of the subtitles was well below par) and decided to not watch them for the story but rather for the people.</p>
<p>One of the movies I analyzed is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493264/">Kurtlar vadisi - Irak</a>&#8220;, (translation: &#8220;Valley of the Wolves - Iraq&#8221;), a movie which starts out after the infamous hood event that took place on July 4th, 2003, shortly after the war began. The movie focuses on the way the people feel after being treated like animals and while the director exercised his artistic freedom to amend the story a little, I think he did a great job in portraying the issues that arise during the situations that were discussed in the movie. It might not have been the best research material I could get, but it certainly had many valid points and taught me a lot about the subject I was researching.</p>
<p>Other than a couple of movies, I also read a lot, both online and in books I retrieved from my mother, who spent a considerable amount of time in middle eastern countries. She also helped me in getting some parts of the cultural information I had compiled right as far as interpersonal contact was concerned. Thanks for that, mom!</p>
<p>After getting myself acquainted with the subject, I, by accident, came across two people, one, a Native Farsi Speaker, who moved around a lot and ended up in Canada and a person who moved from Iraq to the UK. Both of them were more than willing to elaborate in detail how they felt about their respective cultural background and about how they perceived daily life in the Middle East.</p>
<p>While books and movies are a great way to get to know something, I find that talking to people who actually experienced these situations, a lot more informative and a lot more entertaining.</p>
<p>After getting my facts right for the Middle Eastern side of the story, I wanted to get some more information about the American side. Once again, Wikipedia was able to provide me with a lot of the information I looked for and thanks to it&#8217;s great cross linking system, I came across many other resources that taught me about various other aspects that would later contribute to my story.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, I met an ex Marine who immediately jumped at the movie idea and agreed to help with the tactical information and experience I was lacking.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a movie, a very-low-budget one at that and yes, 99% of the people watching it will not catch small things like troops that cover each other in a very specific way or radio chatter that is very &#8220;to the point&#8221;, but for me personally, these things are important. I believe that these  are the details that either make or break a product.</p>
<p>In a few days, you should be able to judge for yourself if my research paid off. I already know that it did, I&#8217;ve gotten to know some pretty interesting people and learned a fair bit about Arabic countries.</p>
<p>So, as far as the research is concerned, I think that the amount of time I put into it certainly meets the expectations I had before I started out. I think I&#8217;ve done more and better research for this one project than I&#8217;ve done for quite a few, bigger, projects in the past.</p>

		<h2 id="post-54"><a href="../../../../../2007/01/23/its-a-free-space/index.html" rel="bookmark">it&#8217;s a free space!</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../projects/index.html" title="View all posts in Projects" rel="category tag">Projects</a> on January 23rd, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Yesterday marked the official beginning of the &#8220;Free Space&#8221; project, I discussed some time ago right <a href="../../../../../blog/college/its-about-how-you-sell-it/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short recap: a year ago, we had a project called &#8220;Free Space&#8221; which disappointed me a lot, the whole project wasn&#8217;t fun to do, nor was it educative and in the end, I nearly ended up without my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECTS">ECTS</a>.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want this year to be a rerun of my first &#8220;Free Space&#8221; and decided that I&#8217;d take matters into my own hands and do something that would link up with the stuff I&#8217;m looking to do in the last two years of my time in college. Long story short, I pitched an idea about making a machinima film and my wish was granted.</p>
<p>So here I am, busy writing, rewriting, restructuring a story that includes references to modern politics, real events and some easter eggs. A story about the war (some) soldiers are facing during the actual war. I think it&#8217;s gonna be a nice cocktail of drama, action and suspense, but you&#8217;ll be able to judge by yourself soon.</p>
<p>My team is spread around the globe, most of them come from the UK and Western Europe in general, but there are also a few hailing from Northern America. Since the time differs as much as eight hours between some of my team mates, we needed a place to store information online, accessible to everyone at any time.</p>
<p>Back in the summer, when I started out with this project, I put most of the content into a forum that was accessible only by invitation but it didn&#8217;t work. There was little to no markup possible and copy would look the same, basically important stuff wasn&#8217;t easily distinguishable and people didn&#8217;t know what to read and what not to read.</p>
<p>The first solution I tried was WordPress, which works amazingly well for just about any content management but sadly didn&#8217;t work at all for this project. In the end, I just set up another subwiki in my Pimki installation and I find that to be working perfectly. Granted, I hack my Pimki (which by itself is a hack of Instiki) installation quite a bit to strip out features I didn&#8217;t need and hack in others I desperately needed, but all in all, the framework is the same and it just works.</p>
<p>Remote team management is so much easier if your team knows how to get to the content they need and if they are able to contribute to it without having to sign up for accounts, that&#8217;s a great plus for everyone.</p>
<p>On another note, thanks to this movie I&#8217;ve even expanded my Python skills a little bit. The game I&#8217;m using to create the movie is based on the Python scripting language and hacking it is insanely easy (well, not insanely easy, but let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s working for me). The result? I&#8217;m creating my own mod, aptly titled &#8220;deeCyne.com: Machinima&#8221;. I consider it a community mod targeted at fellow movie makers who might not be able to use the content because they don&#8217;t want to get their hands dirty.</p>
<p>Both the mod and the hacks I made to Pimki will be released once I&#8217;m done with the movie (though, not immediately afterwards, I&#8217;ll probably take some time off). I found that various sites that were rich with information contributed passively to the making of this movie and as such, giving something back is a logical step to me.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s time to go back and create some more storyboards.</p>
