			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I am in other countries, I try to get some downtime in, so I can watch some local ads, because I always find it interesting to see how other nations deal with problems such as racism, STDs and substance abuse.</p>
<p>On my recent trip to Liverpool, I stumbled across this little gem, which tells the story of Pablo, a dog used to smuggle cocaine in the UK.</p>
<div align="center">
<object width="560" height="345"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/K54-kgkPyek&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0&#038;color1=0x3a3a3a&#038;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param>
<p><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/K54-kgkPyek&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0&#038;color1=0x3a3a3a&#038;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="345"></embed></object>
</div>
<p>The ad, which is part of a series of four, highlights a site called <a href="http://talktofrank.com/home_html.aspx">Talk to Frank</a> where those that are interested can get more information on the effects of cocaine and how to deal with the aftermaths.</p>
<p>The content of the ad is confronting in nature, but not too graphic, which makes the spot accessible for a broad range of people, this is especially true given how the information in the ad is presented.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to see how the <em>emotional factor</em> is used in the ad - after all: would anybody really want to see a cute dog like Pablo cut open just for a few grams of coke?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, I woke up to a <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/26411-1/twitter-dead-laptop-bad-cough.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[229]">a world of hurt</a>: a bad cough and a busted graphics in an aging laptop. </p>
<p>Having faced an identical <em>busted graphics card problem</em> about a year before, too, I knew that repairing my rig would cost me approximately $1,200 to $1,500, depending on the availability of the items that are needed and the amount of man hours required to replace the parts.</p>
<p>While my Toshiba Tecra M4 has served me <em>very</em> well, I am not crazy enough about it to invest such a sum into a device that is 2.5 years old and quite honestly: who would, besides <span title="yes, this is an insider joke, if you do not understand it, that's okay">NASA</span>.</p>
<p>The downside of my decision is that I have been laptop-less for close to six months now and since my Tablet PC acted as my primary computing platform, I am actually finding myself in a position where I get less work done in more time, simply due to the lack of adequate processing power.</p>
<p>Before I set out on my <a href="/tags/a-trip-to-nyc/">trip to the US</a>, I was eying a couple of devices, such as the <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/">Asus EEE PC</a> and even though I do not consider myself a geek, just being able to say that I built a web application with the help of the hottest sub notebook currently available, would have been a fun idea.</p>
<p>From a prosumer point of view, however, the EEE PC is definitely not able to cater for all my wishes and as such would not have been much than a secondary backup, computer as opposed to being my (primary) weapon of choice and as such, the hunt for new hardware continued.</p>
<p>Every few years in my computer life, I come to a point, call it a crossroads if you wish; a point where I decide to (radically) alter the way I go about doing things and go in directions I have not gone before, mostly in an effort to make my computing experience more pleasurable, but also: more efficient.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, this meant going the Pocket PC route and I have not regretted this one bit. Five years ago, it meant foraying down the Symbian Smartphone route, then back to Pocket PCs again.</p>
<p>This, eventually, lead to flirting with a Windows Mobile Smartphone, which worked well, due to its form-factor, but essentially changed my mobile computing habits from &#8220;creating&#8221; to &#8220;reading&#8221;, in other words: my productivity dropped, so back to Pocket PCs it was, once again.</p>
<p>During that period, I also ventured into the area of Tablet PCs, a technology that appeared interesting to me on a number of levels, mostly due to the fact that it altered the way I would be using my device henceforth.</p>
<p>After having used a Tablet PC for 2.5 years and having followed the scene since literally <em>Day One</em>, I can, wholeheartedly say that I did my best to accept it, love it and <em>not</em> hate it, but it just did not work out the way I hoped it would.</p>
<p>The applications that were <em>killer</em> and <em>hot</em> two years ago, are still the same ones that are hot today because, all in all, the Tablet PC ecosystem has not nearly seen as much influx as everyone predicted.</p>
<p>Their impact on the market is, still, negligible at best: Tablets are used by medical professionals and a few other niche areas, but for me, there is no future in this platform and as such, the hunt for new hardware continued, once again.</p>
<p>I knew that my next device, like my aging Tablet PC, would have to be a true Desktop replacement, because switching devices <em>AND</em> keeping them in sync all the time gets annoying really quick.</p>
<p>Another thing I require from my device is that it <em>just works</em>, in the sense that I do not have to install extra software when I hook up a projector, or, even worse: reinstall my whole operating system, because neither the built-in display adapter nor the external display provide me with any (visual) feedback whatsoever.</p>
<p>Naturally, just having a device that works is not all I want, I also wanted to try something new, venture into, for me, uncharted territory, so to speak. The last time around, this ended up being a Tablet PC, which basically was just an extension to the current operating system I was using at the time, this time around, I am inclined to switch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system" rel="wikipedia">operating systems</a> too. </p>
<p>All in all, and more importantly, to bring this story an end, I have decided, that the best I could make is Apple&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> and I am looking forward to, as one friend called it, experience that working with your computer can actually be <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, while I made the decision on my own, I feel that there are two people I should thank, for putting up with my geekness during this <em>trying time</em>:</p>
<p>First and foremost, my biggest thanks go out to <a href="http://nsnelson.wordpress.com/">Nate Nelson</a> who helped me put together my order, helped me change it, helped me order more stuff and even got me some nice extras to play with, thanks bro&#8217;!</p>
<p>Secondly, <a href="http://www.kevinpilasky.nl/blog/">Kevin Pilasky</a> for devoting the last three plus years of his life to make me consider and try out the OS X platform and finally have the guts to move to, and I quote: <em>the system that will work for you!</em> </p>
<p><small><strong>*</strong> for the Apple fanboys who scuff at the mention of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Soul">New Soul</a>&#8221; in combination with a MacBook Pro, I am sorry, I know the song is meant to be used for the MacBook Air, but it was just too tempting.</small></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 25th, 2008, <a href="http://www.gabemac.com/">Gabriel McIntyre</a> of <a href="http://dailybuzz.mobuzz.tv/">Mobuzz</a> fame and former colleague from my time at <a href="/tags/xolotv/">XOLO.TV</a>, held a party to celebrate his 33rd birthday.</p>
<p>As always, the XOLO people prove that they all, are wells of information, wisdom and, most importantly, inspiration.</p>
<p>One of Gabe&#8217;s inspirational quotes got me thinking and I thought that it would be worth sharing with a bigger audience:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you are walking through life, with a big ice cream cone in your hand; tasty chocolate, juicy strawberry or delicious mango - whatever your flavor is - you suddenly happen to step in <em>dog poop</em>.</p>
<p>So now you got dog poop on your shoe and you have a decision to make: you can either concentrate on the dog poop on your shoe and then, at the same time, have that beautiful ice cream melt all over your hand and simply see it disappear.</p>
<p><em>Or</em>, you decide to screw the dog poop on your shoes, and keep on walking and enjoy your nice, tasty, juicy and delicious ice cream cone.</p>
<p>The morale of the story, should be quite obvious: life, at every turn, always presents you with <em>two choices</em>: either dog poop or ice cream cone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pick the right one.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Werner Vogels, the chief technical officer of amazon.com, has spent the last five years developing his company&#8217;s vision of technology.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Amazon, Vogels worked as a computer science researcher at Cornell University, where he investigated the scalability and robustness of mission-critical enterprise computer systems.</p>
<p>He was kind enough to answer us when we stopped by Thursday to ask him &#8220;<em>What&#8217;s up?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><em>What brings you to PICNIC?</em><br />
&#8220;First of all, it was great to get an invitation to speak here,&#8221; Werner says. His driving force is a deep-set curiosity in the Dutch start-up culture: &#8220;I want to get a better understanding of how this interesting mix of creativity and everything is working, because Amsterdam is unique in this sense.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>What do you hope to gain from PICNIC?</em><br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet, I like to be surprised and I am really expecting to be wowed.&#8221; There are myriad innovative things going on here on the lawns of Picnic. To get a better understanding of the whole scene, Vogels is going to hold a brainstorming session with young students, who he finds to be &#8220;usually bursting with ideas.&#8221; </p>
<p>But Amazon&#8217;s chief technical officer also hopes to give something back and share some of his own ideas with the next generation.</p>
<p><em>Business is changing</em><br />
The way businesses are created is changing radically: whereas you used to need a lots of money up front to become successful, entrepreneurs have increasing access to both expertise and a range of services to build up their idea. <em>&#8220;Everyone is trying to be the next YouTube or Facebook&#8221;</em>, Vogels says, but many companies fail to build a sustainable business. <em>&#8220;I will be bringing some good start-ups on stage and talk to them,&#8221;</em> he said, to highlight the challenges they faced and show what they did to create the so-called long tail.</p>
<p><em>A green(er) Amazon</em><br />
When asked what Amazon is doing in terms of becoming a greener company, Vogels said that the world&#8217;s largest eTailer has been optimizing their fulfillment process a lot in recent years, moving away from plastic and toward better, more sustainable packaging as well as giving customers more insight into the carbon footprint of their order.</p>
<p>Also, Vogels notes, Amazon is making their data centers a lot more efficient, which has the welcome side effect of becoming more green.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.zarafa.com/">Zarafa</a> is a software package designed to allow you to share your email and calendars via Microsoft Outlook, your Windows Mobile (and Apple iPhone) device and also access your personal data right through your browser.</p>
<p>Although the official Zarafa page suggests that installing Zarafa is a piece of cake, I have found that said cake was a tad dry, hard to digest and generally: hard to get out of its packaging and it tooks us <a href="/tech-talk/rants/zarafa-604-on-centos-finally/">a number of tries</a> to get Zarafa running with Plesk.</p>
<p>In order to keep others from pulling their hair out, getting mad at their servers, starting to doubt their technical skill and firing off angry emails and posting nasty threads in public forums, I decided to create this tutorial to help you install Zarafa 6.04 on a CentOS 5.2 server with Plesk 8.6.</p>
<p>Please note that the following steps worked for me and I was able to reproduce them on my home server and got the desired result. My main server runs CentOS 5.2 (32-bit version), with Plesk 8.6, Apache 2.2.3, PHP 5.2.6 and mySQL 5.0.58 and I have it set-up to use a dedicated IP for Zarafa Webaccess and also got myself a SSL certificate. </p>
<p>This tutorial assumes that you have a domain called <code>domain.com</code> where you are going to host Zarafa Webaccess and an email account at <code>emaildomain.com</code> - both domains can be the same, this does not alter the tutorial in any way. </p>
<p>It is further assumed that you have set-up <code>domain.com</code> with a dedicated IP and SSL certificate inside Plesk.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The SMS capabilities of Windows Mobile devices have come a long way since first being introduced as part of the <em>Windows Mobile 2003 Pocket PC Phone Edition</em>, but power users like me find that a handful of nifty features are still missing.</p>
<p>Trinket Software&#8217;s first Windows Mobile application, <a href="http://www.trinketsoftware.com/powersms/">PowerSMS</a>, is bound to change this by giving you new tools to play with and making your life easier.</p>
<p><strong>First impressions</strong></p>
<p>When you first fire up PowerSMS, you will be greeted by its straight-to-the-point interface. You have exactly eight options (if you count the buttons) to choose from - and they are finger friendly!</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28054-1/powersms_01.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28055-2/powersms_01.png" alt="PowerSMS start screen" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to believe that the options are sorted by usefulness, at least, I ended up texting myself more often (as a reminder) than scheduling a new message.</p>
<p><strong>Post-It&reg; - SMS style</strong></p>
<p>PowerSMS includes a handy feature that lets you send yourself text messages with the tap of a button. </p>
<p>Especially for users with unlimited text messaging plans, this feature is a real godsend, allowing you to jot down your thoughts in the middle of the night, </p>
<p>For users with unlimited messaging packages, this is a real godsend, especially if you, like me, have the greatest ideas of the day in the middle of nowhere, with no WiFi or 3G available.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Herd Management</strong></p>
<p>When you find yourself spending more and more time with your family, friends or colleagues and you want to inform them all at the same time that you wont be making it, you will love PowerSMS&#8217; group SMS feature.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28059-2/powersms_03.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28060-4/powersms_03.png" alt="PowerSMS Group SMS" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start out by setting up your group: for example: your closest friends who you are planning to meet for a get-together on Friday, to discuss the recent wave of layoffs and how to combat unemployment amongst your group.</p>
<p>Then, after you have added their numbers, tap the group name and Pocket Outlook will open, with all the numbers already filled in, waiting for you to text away.</p>
<p><strong>Text-based secretary</strong></p>
<p>PowerSMS includes a feature that allows you to auto-reply to incoming calls with a text-message. You get to set-up who you want to reply to, how long you have to <em>defuse</em> the process and after that, your secretary takes over:</p>
<div align="center">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Superhero Memory</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go into Dr. Phil mode here for a minute and evaluate the one thing our significant others complain about the most: attention. Sure, you were texting her / him lovely messages in the beginning of your relationship all the time, but as weeks, months and years went by, you scaled back - life got in the way and all.</p>
<p>Now, with PowerSMS, you can fire up your relationship again and pre-schedule small bits of love to be sent to your partner on, seemingly, random dates. </p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28063-1/powersms_05.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28064-2/powersms_05.png" alt="PowerSMS scheduled message" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set-up a few messages when you have a minute or two to spare and reap your rewards as time comes. Effective? Most certainly and it could even be considered morally just if you subscribe to the ideology that <em>Everything is Fair in Love and War</em>.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28065-1/powersms_06.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28066-2/powersms_06.png" alt="PowerSMS scheduled message" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can, also, use this feature to remind your colleagues that a certain meeting up is coming up or to tell your secretary to get a bottle of that really good wine for the boss&#8217; birthday - the possibilities are really endless.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Resources</strong></p>
<p>If there is one thing that most power-users love, it must be statistics, outlining how efficiently they work. PowerSMS answers this craving by including a <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28067-1/powersms_07.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]">large</a> <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28071-1/powersms_09.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]">number</a> of <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28075-2/powersms_11.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]">easy-to-digest</a> statistics, telling you who you message the most, when your peak hours are and the likes:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28069-2/powersms_08.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28070-4/powersms_08.png" alt="PowerSMS statistics" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to quote <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonlan/archive/2008/09/16/powersms-now-released.aspx">Jason Langridge</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>These aren’t my SMS stats BTW as mine are scarily higher and I’m embarrassed to put them on my blog :)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Import / Export business</strong></p>
<p>Last but not least, PowerSMS includes a backup feature, allowing you to import and export your messages to a proprietary format as well as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">comma-separated values</a> file, thereby enabling you to do myriad things with it.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28077-1/powersms_12.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28078-2/powersms_12.png" alt="PowerSMS backup" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have completed your backup, you can import it on another device and either remove all current messages or combine them with the import and, best of all: PowerSMS offers you a possibility to instantly <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/28081-1/powersms_14.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[377]">email the file to yourself</a>, for safe keeping.</p>
<p><strong>In closing:</strong></p>
<p>At $9.95, <a href="http://www.trinketsoftware.com/PowerSMS/">PowerSMS</a> is definitely worth it in the long run: True power-users will love the distribution lists as well as the scheduled messages feature and what&#8217;s more: you also get nifty statistics and the ability to export your messages to XML or CSV files (and possibly: import them again, on another device) or on <a href="javascript:alert('The Treasuremytext importer for PowerSMS dumps is coming soon!');">Treasuremytext</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years and three months ago, a <a href="http://www.jeroenc.eu/">friend of mine</a> and me decided that it would be <em>moderately awesome</em> to have access to our own <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx">Microsoft Exchange Server technology platform</a>.</p>
<p>Being students, however, meant that we could not pony up the cash one needs to get the appropriate licenses and required hardware to actually run those tools, so we set out to find the best solution that would work for us, with the hardware (Linux servers) we have and, obviously: the lowest cost to us, in both the short and long run.</p>
<p>Looking back over the last two years and three months, I think it is a fair assessment to say that we have seen it all:</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho&#8217;s</a> Virtual Office, which performed so sadly that it regularly crashed on our server with only one user actually using it and doing nothing but syncing a few calendar items.</p>
<p>We spent long evenings on doing our best to get it up and running and even managed to get a license for free, by translating the Virtual Office suite into Dutch but we still could not get the hardware to run.</p>
<p>Zoho realized that the Virtual Office platform would not work in its current form, so they rolled it up and created a new product from it: <a href="http://mail.zoho.com/mail/index.do">Zoho Mail</a>, promising that there would be an on-premises version of Zoho within a couple of months. </p>
<p>It never happened, but we did not feel too sad about it, for we had discovered Mintersoft&#8217;s Truedesk, which, like Zoho Virtual Office, utilized a Java backend and managed to crash our server a number of times.</p>
<p>Once again, while testing it on different hardware, it turned out that the software was flawed and Mintersoft folded pretty quickly, too - another bit the dust.</p>
<p>Then came Scalix and PostPath, both of which we were not even able to install for whatever reason(s) I do not remember, so we had to skip those in their entirety.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atmail.com/">@Mail</a>, on the other hand, looked promising, but too expensive since there was no real entry-level license (and who can blame them?), but there was light at the end of the tunnel:</p>
<p>At one point, Jeroen discovered <a href="http://www.zarafa.nl/">Zarafa</a>, built by a Dutch company and, in our eyes, the most interesting contender of all, for Zarafa licensed the actual looks of Outlook Web Access and was able to re-create the original style.</p>
<p>Moreover, Zarafa offered something all the other tools did not: a PHP version. Both their Webaccess component and the Windows Mobile device syncing gateway utilize PHP and can be modified to your heart&#8217;s content. </p>
<p>At first, Zarafa, like the others, did not play well with our set-up: a CentOS 4.x server with Plesk 8.x running on it but we kept at it, mostly because we got a good price on a three user license for Zarafa and we did not want to waste our own money.</p>
<p>Try as we might, it would not work and at one point, we just gave up. Up until a year ago, when we moved to the CentOS 5.x branch and gave it another try, again, to no avail.</p>
<p>For one reason or another, we were always able to get one of the three main components working: we either had syncing with Outlook or syncing with Mobiles or access to our data via a browser, but never, had we access to all three of them.</p>
<p>Ever so often, mostly days after new Zarafa updates were released, we would give it another try. We knew that it worked, we had seen and experienced it first hand, we just never figured out the magical combination that would allow us to make all three components work at the same time.</p>
<p>We went from 5.x to the 6.x branch of Zarafa, we tried 32-bit and 64-bit solutions, but all of them, somehow, did not work the way we wanted them to work, so eventually, we stopped trying again and waited for the next release cycle.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, I decided to give the whole thing another try. I had managed to get Zarafa working on my personal fileserver at home, which also runs on a 32-bit version of CentOS and I was able to sync contacts and Outlook with it, so I knew that there was a way.</p>
<p>Lo&#8217; and behold: I have finally succeeded and created a working solution that encompasses Zarafa 6.04, Plesk 8.3, CentOS 5.2 (32-bit), mySQL 5.0.58 , PHP 5.2.6, Outlook 2007 and Windows Mobile 6 - all secured via SSL and not killing your CPU.</p>
<p>If you are interested in setting up a low-cost, high-yield Microsoft Exchange-compatible gateway, that utilizes your current (CentOS) Linux hardware, click <a href="/tech-talk/guides/zarafa-set-up-guide/">here</a> to read my tutorial on it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apparently, I am the kind of customer that manages to discover problems in bulletproof systems all the time: I have managed to break my former provider&#8217;s online payment solution in a way that any payment I did, would not go through (even though it was deducted from my bank account) and I have managed to get my <a href="/blog/media/marketing/the-things-that-keep-you-coming-back-redux/">PayPal account locked</a>, more than once, because I sent a certain kind of transaction in a special way that would trigger alarms everywhere.</p>
<p>Last week, I managed to discover one such problem in <a href="http://www.vodafone.nl/">Vodafone&#8217;s</a> service: it turns out that, when you switch your subscription type (I am a prepaid user), your extras automatically are terminated.</p>
<p>Being a heavy <a href="/?s=sms">SMS</a> user, I pay Vodafone 10 EUROs up-front for a premium service called &#8220;<a href="http://www.vodafone.nl/prive/prepaid/vodafone_blox/">Zorgeloos SMS BloX</a>&#8220;, which basically translates into a free pass at text messaging - 1000 messages before you have to pay again.</p>
<p>I usually get anywhere between 250 and 400 messages out, every month and as such, the <em>BloX</em> subscription translates into huge savings for me and I was quite appalled when I was told by a CSR that I had already used up my allotted 1000 messages (which would have been a first) and was <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=SOL">SOL</a> and would have to wait until mid-September to get more messages.</p>
<p>Now, you see, the issue here was not that I had to invest additional money, or that Vodafone, supposedly ripped 10 EUROs from me, I could care less about the money, the issue, here, was that I did not like the way they did it - blaming me and not taking into account that their system had failed me, and by extension: them.</p>
<p>Having read about Patrick de Laive&#8217;s <a href="http://1000times1000.com/2007/11/21/vodafone-heldesk-how-can-we-screw-you-sir/">experiences with Vodafone</a> last November, I knew that this would be troublesome to work out and I was prepared to switch to another provider, in the blink of an eye if Vodafone did not play ball.</p>
<p>Today, I received an email from a new CSR at Vodafone, responding to my query and explaining the situation: the representative offered the standard apologies you always get (which, let&#8217;s be honest: have to be included in any such communication, even though most customers do not care about them); he also reactivated my BloX subscription and gave me an additional 5 EUROs for <em>&#8220;any trouble caused&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>All in all, I am glad that Vodafone handled this issue the way they did and not leave me with a feeling of unimportance and deceit. </p>
<p>Granted, the whole deal could have been avoided if their system was (even more) bulletproof, but since their system is built by humans, and humans are bound to make mistakes, this is a more than acceptable outcome.</p>
<p>So, to Vodafone and the represenative that followed up on this issue, I say: thank you for not screwing me over and taking care of me the right way.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="/blog/projects/i-heart-sms">yesterday&#8217;s post</a> about what Treasuremytext is all about and also the announcement of me joining their Board of Advisors, is this visual treat for everybody who loves to tag random things in public &#8230; like I did.</p>
<p>During the Software Social Summer BBQ, back in May, I was able to snag a few <em>I ♥ SMS</em> stickers and I decided that, the best way to expose New York City to <a href="http://www.treasuremytext.com/">Treasuremytext</a>, would be by putting some of their stickers in more or less visible locations, such as <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/26837-2/IMG_0173.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[260]">trains</a>, <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/26942-2/IMG_0249.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[260]">post boxes</a>, <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/26939-2/IMG_0247.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[260]">abandoned cars</a> and the likes.</p>
<p>Even though some may call this pointless, I definitely had my fun and, so far, had three people approach me about the sticker and what the message was all about.</p>
<p>In case you want to see even more tagged areas, head on over to my <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/creative_work/i_heart_sms_tagging/">gallery</a>!</p>
<p>And if you have come this far and still have no idea what Treasuremytext is all about, I suggest you have a look at the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbQbzVdHmts">clip</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of my friends, at least those whose cellphone numbers I have, know that I am an avid texter. I am, so to speak, a master of the arcane skill of speaking volumes with less than 161 characters and as such, I generate quite a bit of SMS traffic every month.</p>
<p>Ever so often, a short message turns into a good conversation and being a true gatherer, I like to save these messages to read through them again at a later point and chuckle about the past.</p>
<p>Up until a few months ago, I used to store all my messages on my Pocket PC and that started filling up my device pretty quickly; in fact, from July 2007 to July 2008, I have sent and received some 1800 text messages, with a fair number of <em>collectible</em> messages.</p>
<p>Back in 2006, during the first <a href="/tags/the-next-web/">The Next Web conference</a>, I came across <a href="http://www.katielips.com/">Katie Lips</a> and <a href="http://kisky.co.uk/">Paul Stringer</a>, from <a href="http://www.treasuremytext.com/">Treasuremytext</a>, a service that would let you save your messages online.</p>
<p>To be honest, back in 2006, I did not see a need for this, for one, the only way to get your messages into the site, was by sending them to a UK phone number, which was too expensive at the time, and what&#8217;s more: why would I want to save my SMS anyway?</p>
<p>In 2007, Treasuremytext, underwent a radical transformation: the site became all 2.0-ish, added more, local numbers (even a Dutch one) and added a new feature: TextStreams.</p>
<p>I was invited to join their beta in December and started using it more and more &#8230; up until the point where I <a href="/blog/projects/from-the-frontlines/">decided</a> that the <a href="http://www.treasuremytext.com/SMS/k.satirli">TextStream</a> feature would make for a nice addition to my blog&#8217;s sidebar, allowing me to microblog from wherever I was.</p>
<p>So far, I have managed to submit more than 130 updates and all in all, I find it a very enjoyable and straight forward experience. Contrary to, say, Twitter, TMT, has not seen any extended downtime since I have been with them and Katie and Paul have been <em>very good sports</em> about <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/treasuremytext">turning suggestions into features</a>, something which makes me, as a user, feel good about the time I put into coming up with new ideas.</p>
<p>Treasuremytext has long been a supporter of the iPhone, with an application that would allow you to upload your SMS with a couple o&#8217; taps directly from an iPhone to your TMT account and being a strong supporter of the Windows Mobile platform, I felt that we could not be left behind.</p>
<p>After a couple of emails, Paul was kind enough to open up the TMT API for me and I was able to build an application that allows you to import all your messages with fewer taps than the iPhone does (take that, Steve!).</p>
<p>The application is not yet released for the public, but that day is not too far off, for I was able to import some 500 messages into my account without problems.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more: Paul and Katie were so happy about my involvement with TMT, that they offered me a position on their <a href="http://thesmsblog.com/2008/08/08/announcing-our-advisory-board/">Board of Advisors</a>, where I will be serving as the resident Social Applications guy, joining both <a href="http://imran.typepad.com/">Imran Ali</a>, who is advising TMT on connections and funding and <a href="http://ikisai.blogspot.com/">Ian Hay</a>, who is advising TMT on being <em>operator-ready</em>.</p>
<p>All in all, I feel both honored and humbled at the same time for being offered such a chance and Treasuremytext is most definitely a service I am willing to spend more time on.</p>
