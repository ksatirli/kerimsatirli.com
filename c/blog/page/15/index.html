		<p>The summer holidays are coming to an end, at last and that means that a whole bunch of young women and men will soon be joining the ranks of students in higher education in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In order to kick-start the college experience for &#8220;our&#8221; new students, <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">CMD Breda</a> will be conducting a three-days-two-nights introductory camp in <a href="http://www.de-mussenberg.nl/mambo/">De Mussenberg</a>, Loon op Zand, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Naturally, yours truly will also be there, helping where help is needed and making the experience a most pleasurable one for our <em>newbies</em>.</p>
<p>One of my favourite indie-bands, <a href="http://destine.nl/">Destine</a>, will also be performing on stage, complemented by our <a href="http://www.janpeeters.nl/">Dean</a> and a few other tutors - so this ought to be interesting.</p>
<p>And finally, Thursday night, I will be attending <a href="http://www.feest.je/">Feest.je</a>, just for the fun of it and hopefully manage to meet a few <a href="http://www.katielips.com/">contacts</a> of <a href="http://eggertonline.com/">mine</a>, too.</p>

		<h2 id="post-132"><a href="../../../../2007/08/26/happy-blog-birthday/index.html" rel="bookmark">Happy Birthday!</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Blog" rel="category tag">Blog</a> on August 26th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>On this day, a year ago, I launched <a href="../../../../blog/two-dot-oh/index.html">lifeofacoder.com 2.0</a>; my third attempt at blogging. My goal, back then, was to blog at least once every three to four weeks and share some insights about <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">my college</a> with anyone interested.</p>
<p>Now, a year later, I have managed an average of two posts a week, much more than I originally anticipated. I have <a href="http://inmyvision.net/">sparked</a> quite <a href="http://matterofpersuasion.com/">a few</a> discussions amongst friends, both virtual and analogue.</p>
<p>Then, back in June, I switched from lifeofacoder.com to <a href="../../../../index.html">kerimsatirli.com</a>. I never really blogged about that, but the reason for the whole move was rather simple:</p>
<p>Names are brands and it was about time that I started working on my own brand. I like the &lt;firstname&gt;&lt;lastname&gt;.com concept a lot more than &lt;random-name&gt;.com; mostly because I never came up with something that I was really content with as far as &lt;random-name&gt;.com goes.</p>
<p>With a &lt;firstname&gt;&lt;lastname&gt;.com however, the whole thing is a lot easier. It is simple to remember and makes a lot more sense than discussing the <em>life of a coder</em>, especially since I am no real coder (anymore).</p>
<p>With the domain switch, I also decided that it was time to adjust the style of the blog and hey, what do you know, after looking through a myriad of themes, I finally found <a href="http://lucianmarin.com/journalist/">Journalist</a>. It is clean, lean and does not take away focus from the part of the site that matters most to me: content.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve my language skills, I have also switched from a relatively casual style of writing to a more professional style, but the judges are still out on a verdict for this one.</p>
<p>That said, there are a couple of entries I would like to highlight, mostly posts about things that I found worthy to share and entries that I am proud off:</p>
<p>In December 2006, I wrote about <a href="../../../../blog/personal/micro-relationships/index.html">Micro relationships</a>, which is my take on Relationship 2.0. The article also, partially links up with my thoughts on <a href="../../../../blog/college/what-is-identity/index.html">what identity really means</a>.</p>
<p>Also during the final days of December 2006, I posted my <a href="../../../../blog/personal/thank-you/index.html">Thank you</a> article. While I am not religious in any sense, I think it is important to remind ourselves every now and again that <em>this is a group effort, not a solo gig</em>.</p>
<p>Valentine&#8217;s Day 2007 saw a post called <a href="../../../../blog/personal/heres-to-you/index.html">Here&#8217;s to you</a>, which is my ode to a person that I care about a lot, even though I never really had the guts to show it.</p>
<p>During March 2007 I blogged about the <a href="../../../../blog/college/distorted-perception/index.html">perception of life</a> and how others are able to distort it.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many more items that I am happy with and sometimes even proud of, but these are the ones I personally liked the most.</p>
<p>On very much related note, two people I value immensely are celebrating their respective birthdays today, too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to you, <a href="http://www.benreedy.com/">Ben</a> and Judith!</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 21st, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>I just received an email from a user at <a href="http://www.xdaflameusers.com/">xdaflameusers.com</a> asking me about some general information on the device in question and so on.</p>
<p>While I would rather see said person asking their question in the forums, so that everyone can benefit from the answers, I still decided to type up an answer, but that is not the point of the email.</p>
<p>After sending my reply, I decided to do a quick lookup on the person I was &#8220;talking&#8221; to and grabbed some of the data that was available from the email header and forum software.</p>
<p>The name revealed a profile on <a href="http://www.hyves.nl/">a popular Dutch social networking site</a> but other than that, did not provide me with any more information, so I used the second piece of information I had, an IP address.</p>
<p>It turns out that the IP address that was used to register on the forums is part of a block that was delegated to <a href="http://www.achmea.nl/">Achmea Active</a>. After searching around a bit, it would appear that the IP was mainly used for vandalism on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, I should note that, in this case, the IP is shared amongst a great number of users and I do not believe that the person that mailed me is amongst the group of people that vandalized Wikipedia, but it made me think about how digital communication could evolve (for me).</p>
<p>In real life, I do not talk to people I know have a bad reputation, especially if they did something that goes against my core values and I am thinking of adopting a similar system for online communication. This kind of background-check would take some time to conduct, every time, but it could be limited to those contacts one is not familiar with; those contacts that contact you out of the blue.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on August 21st, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Dutch cross media network <a href="http://www.immovator.nl/">iMMovator</a> <a href="http://www.immovator.nl/cross-media-zomercafe-speciale-editie-met-minister-ronald-plasterk">kicked off</a> the new season of their <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20964-2/IMG_3398.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[129]">CrossMediaCafe</a> events yesterday with an interesting event.</p>
<p>The guest of honor was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Plasterk">Ronald Plasterk</a>, Minister of Education, Culture and Science. When asked as to what kind of technology he uses in his daily life, he made a remark about his recent vacation to Bali, stating that &#8220;<em>he uploaded a couple of eps of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28TV_series%29">24</a> to his iPod so he could watch them during his trip</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Naturally, the above statement should be taken with a grain of salt, after all, can one <em>really</em> trust politicians? Political views aside however, Plasterk struck me as authentic. He listened to what people had to say and provided insight into why he did certain things.</p>
<p>This was only the second time I met a Minister and the first time I actually liked the guy. Very non-condescending and approachable. No fancy security guys to shield the guy from the audience and a highly likable appearance.</p>
<p>His statement on Blackberry usage during cabinet meetings was great too: &#8220;my mother taught me that it is very inappropriate and plain jerk&#8217;ish to not look someone in the face when they are talking to you&#8221; (this is not verbatim, but Plasterk&#8217;s statement came down to that)</p>
<p>Later on, Paul Rutten from <a href="http://www.inholland.nl/">Hogeschool InHolland</a> commented that Blackberrys actually increase the efficiency of people and as a user of these kind of technologies, I would have to agree, nonetheless, the point Plasterk makes about it being rude still applies.</p>
<p>One of the keynotes also contained some interesting information. It appears as if one third of the dutch IT / creative industry seems to be concentrated around the so-called Noordvleugel, namely Amsterdam and Hilversum with a respectable growth and many small, innovative companies. It might not be Silicon Valley yet, but it may put us on the next <a href="../../../../blog/media/fast-cities-2007/index.html">Fast Cities</a> listing.</p>
<p>Then came the, for me, highlight of the whole conference - Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten speech on Entrepreneurship and ways of becoming an entrepreneur in today&#8217;s world and how he became the man he is today.</p>
<p>The speech was hands down the best thing about the whole conference / meeting because Boris dares to show that all you need is some big cojones and the strength to get up when someone tries to knock you down. For those that are interested, head on over to <a href="http://bomega.com/2007/08/21/spoken-column-text/">bomega.com</a> and read the speech, it is definitely worth it.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20967-2/IMG_3387.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[129]">Boris</a>, the Dutch educational system is not built for success and only breeds &#8220;hive workers&#8221; that have little to no ambition to advance in their profession. This is being backed up by the fact that only 7% of Dutch students actually plan on setting up their own company, compare that to the 70% of American students and that&#8217;s <em>&#8217;nuff said</em>. Just about everyone in the Netherlands who goes into higher education, does that for the sole purpose of finding a job where you can apply for, people lack the motivation to come up with something innovative.</p>
<p>In the end, <a href="http://www.bomega.com/">Boris</a> says, it all comes down to selling yourself (or your product, for that matter) the right (successful) way.</p>
<p>Pitching is something we do 24/7; at your company, when you try to convince your boss that you need more funding for that awesome idea you have, with your co-workers, when they do not feel like working late but you still need them and of course, with your significant other, when you need them to sign off on your next big purchase.</p>
<p>Boris thinks that the Netherlands (although, this would apply to any country really) would do a lot better, internationally speaking, if presentation skills would carry a higher importance in the educational system. With <em>&#8220;only one oral presentation every year, as opposed to one oral presentation EVERY week in the US</em>&#8220;, it is no wonder that our students are scared of pitching something.</p>
<p>The lack of serious presentation skills (or should that be: the serious lack of presentation skills?) was also obvious during some of the showcases speeches:</p>
<p>First up was Wobble, a product from <a href="http://www.momentuminteraction.nl/">Momentum Interaction</a>. Wobble is a piece of wood you can step on and use as a kind of enhanced joypad. The system can be connected to a PC and gathers an array of data that can be used for medical purposes.</p>
<p>While the system in itself is nice enough, the suggested price of more than $4,000 made me laugh. For one, the system, in its current state is a long way from actually being production-ready and moreover, 18 months ago, I came across a similar system at my own college, which was built over the span of nine weeks as opposed to ten months (which was the time Momentum Interaction needed).</p>
<p>The &#8220;home&#8221; version of Wobble will have an approximate price of $150 to $250 and will be easier to set up. It does make one wonder how a device that costs $4,000 for medical usage, can end up at less than 1/10 of the price in a retail customer&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Any consumer will expect a range of games that can be used with the device and the looks and usage would have to be improved too, all factors that would drive the price up as opposed to down, yet Momentum Interaction thinks that the home product can be sold at that price.</p>
<p>I am no analyst, but seeing what &#8220;<a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">our guys</a>&#8221; came up with really makes me think if the approach that was used for Wobble was the right one &#8230;</p>
<p>The second showcase was <a href="http://www.stoneroos.nl/">Stoneroos</a> which was, no offense to the presentator, the worst presentation I have ever seen. Did someone forget to tell the lady that folding your hands is a no-go for presentations? Oh and &#8220;uhm&#8221; and &#8220;err&#8221; do not work that well either.</p>
<p>This may be out of line, seeing how Stoneroos is an accomplished company with a <a href="http://www.stoneroos.nl/portfolio/clients">nice portfolio of clients</a>, but wow, one would expect that as a CEO, you would have the time to prepare a well thought out and clear presentation and do a dry run at least once to get some feedback.</p>
<p>Stoneroos&#8217; product itself, the iFanzy (whats with the &#8220;i&#8221; by the way?) is a solid product but I wonder why I would want to use that , limited, platform as opposed to something along the lines of Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>One of the guests commented that Stoneroos lacks focus; their product portfolio includes electronical program guides, games and other services and you can tell that Stoneroos is trying to be a Jack of all trades; at the cost of being a Master of none.</p>
<p>The third showcase was about <a href="http://www.wunderwall.nl/">Wunderwall</a>, a product that enables you to utilize the wisdom of crowds for various tasks on your computer. While the name in itself is not really something I would go for (it might work great in a German speaking locale), the product in itself is an innovative and useful solution.</p>
<p>Wunderwall enables multiple users to take part in the presentation / application that is displayed on a screen, allowing everyone to interact with the various elements. The &#8220;mutliple users, single location&#8221; principle was well thought through and the presentation was great too. No Dick Hardt, but still better than the other showcases.</p>
<p>The final showcase was about AVI Drome, a product from <a href="http://www.parkpost.nl/">ParkPost</a>; the product in itself did not catch my interest, simply because it is very location specific and not geared towards home / office users but rather companies in the (audio / visual) media creation sector.</p>
<p>Boris claimed early that the number one angst in the Netherlands is giving a presentation and looking at how badly half of the showcases was delivered, one must really wonder how it is that <a href="http://generation-next.nl/">a student community</a> can find a better selection of showcases for their events than a national <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20970-2/IMG_3391.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[129]">cross media network</a>.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on August 18th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>It is said that, the way a person wakes up defines their mood for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>For me, this is definitely true, if I wake up with a bad mood, I will most certainly be cranky throughout the day, but if I wake up in a relaxed kind of way, I will be able to go about my daily routine in a much more positive way.</p>
<p>One thing I love after waking up, no matter which time it is, is music. Not that I do not love music in the evening or during the day, but a few good tunes here and there can get you started into your day and are as important to me as a good breakfast.</p>
<p>The other day, I was looking for some relaxing music, I came across a software called <a href="http://www.mywakeuptunes.com/home.htm">MyWake-UpTunes</a>, which supposedly makes your waking up experience <em>&#8220;a good one&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>While the software seems to be nice enough, the thing I really like is their <a href="http://www.mywakeuptunes.com/productInfo/soundtrack.htm">soundtrack</a>.</p>
<p>Composed by <a href="http://www.willmusser.com/">Will Musser</a>, these tunes are a collection of <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20625-1/mywakeuptunes.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[127]">energizing</a> and inspiring tracks that are simply a pleasure to listen to, not just in the morning but whenever you are looking for some music to tone down a little and get rid of some stress.</p>
<p>Go grab yourself a copy, you will not regret it.</p>
