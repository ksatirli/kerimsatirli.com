		<p>In a couple of hours, the third edition of the <a href="http://2008.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web</a> conference will be held at the picturesque <a href="http://www.westergasfabriek.com/home/home.php">Westergasfabriek</a> and once again, I am excited to be able to attend.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-recap/index.html">Last year&#8217;s edition</a> definitely rocked and there is a good chance that this year is going to be equally as good, if not better.</p>
<p>The past two edition both were day-long events with a number of interesting speakers, good talks and an equally awesome <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-‚%2580%2593-dinner-awards-show-and-after-party-party-recap/index.html">after-party</a>, this year however, the conference, including side-events is set to last three days.</p>
<p>Considering that I have had little luck with WiFi during the past two editions and even though, <a href="http://www.bomega.com/">Boris</a> <a href="http://thenextweb.org/2008/03/30/thenextweb2008-update-no-wifi/">promised better WiFi support</a> this year, I will be giving previously mentioned mobile 2.0 service <a href="http://treasuremytext.com/">Treasuremytext</a> a try.</p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of Fast Company&#8217;s announcement about <a href="../../../../blog/media/fast-cities-2007/index.html">Fast Cities</a> and the lack thereof as far as Europe goes, Saul Klein and Reshma Sohoni announced their newest initiative called <a href="http://www.seedcamp.com/">Seedcamp</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/07/launching-seedcamp.html">Klein</a>&#8217;s vision is simple:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re looking for the brightest and the best young entrepreneurs across Europe, Middle East and Africa to blow us away with their ideas for game-changing businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s even better is that Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten, of <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-recap/index.html">The Next Web</a> fame, decided to <a href="http://bomega.com/2007/07/12/seedcamp/">provide some additional exposure</a> to two of the selected Seedcamp teams.</p>
<p>Watch out Fast Company, next year, Europe will most certainly have a lot more to show than we did this year.</p>

		<p>In today&#8217;s highly linked world, one might say that the geographical location of a business does not matter anymore, after all, the Internet lets you work with anyone, anytime anywhere, right?. Wrong, businesses still depend on good locations and there are people out their that want you to help with finding the right one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a>, just published their <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/cities/2007/">2007 listing</a> of <em>Fast Cities</em>. The list is essentially a guide on great (perfect?) places to start your new business:</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re smart, young, newly graduated from a university with the whole world before you. You could settle in a small town with well-tended lawns, pancake suppers, and life on a human scale. Or you could truck it to the big city, with all its din and dog-eat-dog lunacy. Your choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>While the list in itself is pretty interesting and contains good advice on the various hot spots, I wonder why so few European cities and especially not one Dutch city made the cut.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a kind <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-morning-recap/index.html">fright</a> amongst European companies as far as innovation and great business ideas go, but still, we aren&#8217;t doing <em>that</em> bad, are we?</p>
<p>Microsoft choose to beta test their <a href="http://www.live.com/">Live</a> service in the Netherlands first. Why? Because we have the highest broadband penetration in the whole western world.</p>
<p>Whenever you check out new technology, there is some kind of Dutch influence. Be i that we helped produce the product, helped support it or just am the nation with the most users of said product.</p>
<p>We might not always come in first, but we surely are not the last ones to finish, so why are we not on the Fast City listing?</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../../../c/blog/media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on June 8th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>The first edition of The Next Web conference featured an after-party that was held at Boris‚Äô private residence in the heart of Amsterdam, five minutes from the venue where the conference was held. While I‚Äôm certain that Boris could have rented a huge party area, I loved the fact that he managed to keep the whole thing on a very social level. Basically, it was like meeting some old friends for a quick beer after work. Only difference to a normal ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù was that those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were specialists and gurus such as Kevin Kelly, AMS-IX and mabber.com representatives, among many others. The personal aspect, combined with a location that provided users with four (geographical) areas to hold conversations, proved most useful for networking purposes.</p>
<p>This year, Boris decided to rent the famous club / restaurant / all-round great place Odeon, one of Amsterdam‚Äôs hottest bars and the main location of the 2006 after party. Great move on Boris part, ‚Äòcause it prevented the group from breaking up too soon. Out of the approximately 500 people that attended the conference, some 150 showed up for the Dinner at the Odeon and, after some small talk, enjoyed a great dinner, with each other.</p>
<p>Prior to the actual dinner, I came across Marjolijn van den Assem, Boris mother and engaged her in a conversation about the conference and the day‚Äôs events. Even though van den Assem isn‚Äôt your typical Web 2.0 conference attendee, it was obvious that she really paid close attention to what the speakers at the conference talked about.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, I managed to get a seat at the Veldhuijzen van Zanten table that was a bit more secluded that the rest and provided a great environment for interesting talk. I happened to know van den Assem from Boris <a href=http://www.bomega.com/>blog</a> and I have to say that I haven‚Äôt had such an interesting conversation in a long time. As a person who is deeply interested in Nietzsche, van den Assem devoted the last 30 years of her life to studying the teachings of the scientist. Her work was recently published in a book called ‚ÄúSeelenbriefe‚Äù.</p>
<p>Talking to van den Assem is a cleansing experience; she, unlike others, really listens to what you have to say and isn‚Äôt afraid to share her own experiences with you, basically, this is all you need to keep a conversation going for a long time.</p>
<p>Then, at 8 pm, Veldhuijzen van Zanten kicked off the <a href="http://awards.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web 2007 Awards</a> show. The whole experience was great, especially because I got to accept an award that was actually destined for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Jimbo, apparently, could not make it to the show, so they picked the next best guy, <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20252-1/531238157_a8d31ee66d_b.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[87]">me</a> (make sure to click on that link, it really is worth it!).</p>
<p>After a great Awards show, the real after-party started, but I will let <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/thenextweb_07/">the photographs</a> speak for themselves.</p>
<p>All in all, <em>The Next Web 2007</em> was as great as the 2006 edition, if not even greater. I learned a lot, met a lot of interesting people and had an awesome time.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations Boris (and crew) for managing to set up something as kick-ass as this.</p>
