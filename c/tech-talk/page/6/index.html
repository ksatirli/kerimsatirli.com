	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on July 20th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Pocket PC are becoming more and more of a replacement for small time computing. They may not yet be able to replace your office PC for a 100% but typing a long email, doing some mobile blogging or other input sensitive tasks is no uncommon thing anymore.</p>
<p>In recent years, a number of devices have been released with integrated keyboards and you can of course always attach an external keyboard to your device, but there is still a huge amount of Pocket PCs that have to rely on Software Input Panels (SIP) to get the job done. With such a big (potential) customer base, it is only natural that companies will try to come up with solutions that make your life easier.</p>
<p>One of these solutions is TenGo Thumb, a SIP that is big enough to be used with your thumbs (yet, it still works very well with a stylus). The application is aimed at people that want to <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19926-1/tengo_thumb_2.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[104]">input</a> data quickly and easily on the go, without going through the additional hassle of pulling a stylus out of its silo.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of thumb</strong></p>
<p>After installing <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19924-1/tengo_thumb_1.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[104]">TenGO Thumb</a> and starting any application that requires text input, you will be presented with a choice to either skip or follow the TenGO Thumb tutorial. While you could use the SIP without any training, I would recommend you to go through the included tutorial, for the simple reason that more advanced things like spelling words that are not yet in your dictionary, are hard to do if you have no clue as to how you can activate such a feature.</p>
<p>TenGO Thumb&#8217;s biggest advantage over many other large-button SIPs is that it includes a predictive text input feature called the TenGO core engine. With it, you can easily <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19930-2/tengo_thumb_4.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[104]">type words</a> and just as easily go back and <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19932-2/tengo_thumb_5.png" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[104]">correct</a> the word(s) you typed. Another useful feature of TenGO is that it stores your most used words at the most left part of the list, which can help if you type the same words a lot. You can see, in part, how the engine works, by looking at the characters that are displayed in the small box on the right hand side.</p>
<p><strong>Thumbing a ride</strong></p>
<p>Now, all of this is certainly very interesting, but we all know that a picture speaks a thousand words, so I decided to create a short video clip of someone typing an email, because, if a picture is able to speak a thousand words, this clip will speak volumes.</p>
<p>The clip is available in a variety of flavors, you can watch it right now in your browser, by going to the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/external/tech-talk/reviews/tengo-thumb/tengo_thumb.swf" class="lightwindow" params="lightwindow_width=482,lightwindow_height=682" title="TenGO Thumb" >Flash version</a> (4.7 mb), or you can download a smaller WMV version <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/kerimsatirli/tech-talk/reviews/tengo-thumb/tengo_thumb_wmv.html">here</a> (2.4 mb).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the typing is a lot faster than the screen recorder is capable of recording and as such, you only see one third of the keys actually being hit.</p>
<p>Another thing that you are <em>not</em> seeing is that I am actually using my thumbs to type the email. Based on the visual setup of TenGO Thumb, which basically comes down to six large keys for the various characters, typing long texts becomes a lot easier.</p>
<p><strong>Thumb Problem</strong></p>
<p>When I first came across TenGO Thumb, I installed it on a Windows Mobile 2003 device where it worked without a hitch. Then came my new Pocket PC and I installed the SIP there too but I had trouble activating it. In two out of five cases, the keyboard would not open and the only way to get it working again was a soft-reset.</p>
<p>Soft-resetting your device all the time, while harmless, gets annoying really quick and so I contacted the TenGO support team. I have to admit that I have not met support guys that walk the extra marathon (yes, marathon, not just mile) for a future customer like TenGO did. A dozen possible ways to solve the problem later, I ended up removing some of the (preinstalled) O2 applications from my Pocket PC and voil√† the keyboard opens whenever I need it and I have not had a problem with it since.</p>
<p><strong>Thumbs up or down?</strong></p>
<p>All in all, <a href="http://tengo.net/tengo_thumb.html">TenGO Thumb</a> is a great piece of software and makes typing on Pocket PCs without a keyboard a lot easier and a lot more efficient. Even with big thumbs, you will not face any problems and with predictive text input, you will be typing away at your first mobile novel in no time. At a mere <a href="http://www.digibuy.com/cgi-bin/order.html?xrgomics+112010248784">$12.95</a>, this application is a steal and will pay for itself in no time.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, TenGO Thumb gets a definite thumbs up from me. The only downside I can see with this application is that you might be able to damage your screen if you are using your device without a <a href="../../../../tech-talk/reviews/urban-armor-for-your-personal-assistant/index.html">good screen protector</a>.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on July 18th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>While <a href="http://www.electronicarts.com/">EA</a> is gracing the world with (yet another) <em>The Sims</em> spin off, called &#8220;<a href="http://crunchgear.com/2007/07/17/sims-bowling-released-for-ipod/">The Sims Bowling</a>&#8220;, PDAmill just released a <a href="http://www.pdamill.com/prod_bo.shtml">bowling simulation</a> that actually sounds like fun.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Food meets Physical Education</strong></p>
<p>Most Pocket PC gamers know PDAmill from the Arvale franchise, a collection of amazingly funny RPGs. I have enjoyed PDAMill games in the past and naturally, I wanted to see if this title would manage to live up to my expectations too.</p>
<p>I have to admit up front that I am not much of a bowler. I know that the ball has to knock over the pins and that you are not supposed to throw the ball in a way that would make it jump lanes or even damage the lane, but apart from that, I never really got into the game.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the competition</strong></p>
<p>The Bowling for Burgers Tournament has been going for some time now and you&#8217;re in the final stage of the tournament. <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19845-1/bowling_for_burgers_2.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">Three players</a> left. The cool <em><a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19847-1/bowling_for_burgers_3.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">Slick Bacher</a></em>, the lovely <em>Maggie Monroe</em> and the no-nonsense <em>Mr. Cube</em>. All three of them have different attributes; while one might have an incredible amount of luck (most probably, due to her looks), the others enjoy a high level of strength or accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t mind your step</strong></p>
<p>With normal bowling, you would get a foul if you were to step over the line, it would void any points you received for your <em>delivery</em> and you would be one step closer to losing. With Bowling for Burgers, you do not have to concern yourself with all these complicated things, you just have to play.</p>
<p>Rolling the ball is simple: pick a good starting position (hint: the center of the lane is a good start) and then <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19851-1/bowling_for_burgers_5.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">swipe your stylus</a> in the direction you want the ball to go. The stronger your swipe, the faster the ball will go.</p>
<p>You can further influence the way the ball interacts with the pins by <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19849-1/bowling_for_burgers_4.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">adjusting the weight</a> or by hitting (or avoiding) one of the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19855-1/bowling_for_burgers_7.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">extras</a>:</p>
<p>Since this competition is heavily sponsored by burger joints, you will occasionally find yourself in a situation where a strange object appears on your lane. It might be good, it might be bad, the only way to find out what kind of effect it has is to roll your ball over it.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19855-2/bowling_for_burgers_7.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19856-4/bowling_for_burgers_7.jpg" alt="Bowling for Burgers: one of the extras" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is simple: knock down as many pins as possible. If you manage to knock down all ten on your first roll, you hit a <em><a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19854-2/bowling_for_burgers_6.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">strike</a></em>, if you manage to &#8220;clean up&#8221; with your second roll, its called a <em><a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19857-1/bowling_for_burgers_8.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">spare</a></em>. The more pins you knock down, the higher <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19859-1/bowling_for_burgers_9.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">your score</a> will be after the last frame and who knows, you might even manage to hit a <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19946-1/bowling_for_burgers_11.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]">turkey</a>.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19851-1/bowling_for_burgers_5.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[102]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19852-2/bowling_for_burgers_5.jpg" alt="Bowling for Burgers: Delivery" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blow or blowout?</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for a dead serious bowling simulation, Bowling for Burgers is not for you. This game is as funny as bowling can get without real people. There&#8217;s the entertaining 50&#8217;s music, beautifully drawn graphics and, in general a great user experience, because gamers do not need to know anything about the game.</p>
<p>The game will <a href="http://www.clickgamer.com/moreinfo.htm?pid=14226&#038;b=TECHTALK">set you back</a> about $20 and will keep you entertained for many hours. Bowling for Burgers is one of those titles that you can keep playing no matter what. It does not start to annoy you after a few rounds and has a high replayability factor.</p>
<p>A trial version is <a href="http://www.pdamill.com/files/bowling_ppc_demo.exe">available</a> at PDAmill&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pdamill.com/prod_bo.shtml">site</a>, so I suggest you check out the game for yourself.</p>
<p><small><br />
A big <em>thank you</em> goes out to <a href="http://nsnelson.wordpress.com/">Nate Nelson</a> for providing me with all those fancy bowling terms and explaining the basic rules of the game to me.<br />

		<p>When you&#8217;re a technological nomad, there&#8217;s one thing you can&#8217;t live without: power. Your Pocket PC isn&#8217;t worth anything if you can&#8217;t power it up, an iPod without juice is like those old LP albums your dad has in the basement: useless.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.proporta.com/">Proporta</a>, you can now charge your devices while you&#8217;re in a car. All you need is an USB cable that connects to your device and a cigarette lighter outlet. Pretty ingenious design if you ask me, because the USB port enables you to use <em>any</em> device you own with the plug.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://proporta.com/F02/PPF02P05.php?t_id=318&#038;t_mode=des">accessory</a> sets you back a mere $8.95 and you&#8217;ll be thankful that you got it when you still had a chance. Right now, Proporta is even running a promotion where you can get one for free as long as you order something else from them. Get yours while they still have stock!</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../reviews/index.html" title="View all posts in Reviews" rel="category tag">Reviews</a> on July 12th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Only two weeks ago, James from <a href="http://www.isotope244.com/">isotope244</a> presented his latest creation to the world. Yesterday, the final version of <a href="http://www.isotope244.com/machines-at-war.html">Machines at War</a> was released. Reason enough for me to take a closer look at what promises to be the hottest real time strategy (RTS) game of the summer:</p>
<p><strong>The Art of War</strong></p>
<p>If you ever played <a href="http://www.isotope244.com/atomic_cannon_pocket.html">Atomic Cannon (Pocket)</a>, you already know that isotope244 prides themselves with the creation of amazing graphics. James and his crew are using the Atom Engine once again and even though this is the same technology that powered games as long as three years ago, the graphics still look better than with most other current Pocket PC games.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19735-1/3.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">loading screens</a> of <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19729-1/1.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">the game</a> are probably the first artwork you will pay attention to: depicting aggressive, yet strangely beautiful scenes of battle, they make the (mostly short) loading times bearable.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19735-1/3.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19736-2/3.jpg" alt="Machines of War: loading screen" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be presented with a spartan interface: a sidebar to the right with access to the game menu, the help function, with a <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19737-1/4.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">useful tutorial</a> and buttons for four of your attack teams and a shortcut to get back to your base.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19739-1/5.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">lower third</a> of the screen is used by, what I like to call, the command and control bar: It provides the player with all the information that is needed.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19739-1/5.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]"><img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19740-2/5.jpg" alt="Machines of War: Command and Control Interface" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the left are the meters for credits, power and the primary form of income of this game: Ore. Right next to it is the most important part of the control interface: your build tools. What I liked most about the building process is that you can <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19739-1/5.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">queue up</a> as many units as you want (well, can afford anyway) and also get to see a little timer that tells you when to expect your reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>Epic Movie: no, epic battles: yes!</strong></p>
<p>Battles these days aren&#8217;t fun anymore, you see a group of soldiers fighting a few stray rebels in some desert country and maybe, just maybe, you&#8217;ll see a tank every now and then and if you&#8217;re really lucky, you&#8217;ll see some explosions.</p>
<p>Machines of War is different, here the old principle of overwhelming force still applies to and boy, what a feast this is. You may be playing this on a Pocket PC or Smartphone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t enjoy battles that take up multiple screens. Yes, you could build small strike teams and take out the enemy one-by-one, but believe me, its a lot more fun to just <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19743-1/7.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">crush the enemy</a> with your whole platoon and then take one final look at <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19745-1/8.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">the destruction</a> you caused.</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep your ears happy too, isotope244 created a whole array of sounds. Combined with a fitting score that adds to the flair of the game but doesn&#8217;t disrupt your focus, you can enjoy the various explosions and weapon sounds and you might even hear the occasional radio chatter.</p>
<p><strong>The Borg will adapt and so will Machines of War</strong></p>
<p>RTS games can be very difficult, after all, keeping up with the needs of a huge army isn&#8217;t exactly a piece of cake. Luckily, isotope244 included a variety of different mutators you can adjust to make the game as hard (or easy) as you want to. Most of these mutators are pretty standard, like the amount of money and resources or the speed of the game but there are two that are quite uncommon:</p>
<p>Machines of War provides you with the possibility to play the game with <em><a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19733-1/2.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">adaptive</a></em> difficulty. What that means is that, the better you are, the harder the CPU player(s) will retaliate. This is a great way to play the game without having to fear that your enemy will be too easy to defeat.</p>
<p>The other feature is the so-called <em>AutoPlay</em> option of the game helps you with building your base. You can just sit back and let the CPU build your defenses for you, but you can also intervene when you deem it necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Military Science</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re in the army now, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that you don&#8217;t have to study. Well, not you, Commander, but your underlings do, and they are very good at it. Machines of War has one of these rare R&#038;D features that allows you to improve your units as you play the game.</p>
<p>Granted, you could beat the game without ever upgrading any unit at all, but its a lot easier to have those eggheads research some new toys and then put them to good, military, use. The best part of this is probably that, besides a set amount of time, you don&#8217;t have to spend anything on <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19790-2/10.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">these upgrades</a>.</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Long story short</strong></p>
<p>All in all, Machines of War is a great game. It&#8217;s fun to play, easy to understand and has enough options to keep you coming back for more for a long time. I expect this game to be just as popular with mobile Commanders around the world as Atomic Cannon was so get <a href="http://www.clickgamer.com/moreinfo.htm?pid=14534&#038;&#038;b=TECHTALK">your copy</a> now, because, as far as Pocket PC games go, you can&#8217;t spend $20 better right now and who knows, you might even find the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/19798-1/12.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[98]">easter egg</a> that&#8217;s included.</p>
<p>The only thing that I am missing in this game is some form of multiplayer support but who knows, a feature like that might be available in a future version&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Update - July 21st, 2007</strong><br />
I just uploaded a couple of screenshots that show the destruction of terrain over time. Please be aware that these images are 1600 x 1600 pixels and come in at 1.2 mb each, but they are definitely the download.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Tech Talk" rel="category tag">Tech Talk</a> on July 9th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>While enjoying some drinks with Dick Hardt at this year&#8217;s <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-recap/index.html">The Next Web Conference</a>, a random guy approached us and handed us a business card each. On first thought, I took it for a feeble attempt to get his name out and just put the card away.</p>
<p>The next day, after reviewing the stash of goodies that I collected, I took a better look at the card and it turned out to be a voucher for a free <a href="http://fon.com/">FON</a> router.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with the thought of setting up a <a href="https://shop.fon.com/FonShop/shop/GB/ShopController?view=product&#038;product=PRD-001">La Fonera</a> for quite some time now, but always decided not to proceed with my plan, because of the initial cost.</p>
<p>Long story short: I&#8217;m now running the (currently) only FON router in this neighborhood and if you happen to be a FON user too, feel free to stop by and snag up some of my WiFi.</p>
