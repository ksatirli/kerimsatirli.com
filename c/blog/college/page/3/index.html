	<div class="main">
		<p>In the past years, I have <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kerimsatirli">worked</a> for a great number of companies; they all served a different purpose – while one was purely about content generation, another was producing software and yet another focused on the building of websites for corporate communication.</p>
<p>I have long been fascinated by what is called the “social web” and it is with great pleasure that I can finally announce what a handful of people have known for about a month now: I am the latest intern to join Dutch-American start-up <a href="http://www.xolo.tv/">xolo.tv</a>.</p>
<p>I was in the fortunate position of being able to choose from a handful of different companies for my first internship, but in the end, the products that <em>xolo.tv</em> are developing are the ones that appeal to me the most.</p>
<p><em>xolo.tv</em>’s platform was first introduced to me back during <a href="../../../../../blog/media/events/picnic07/index.html">PICNIC’07</a>, when <a href=” http://mindcaster.wordpress.com/ “>Marc van Woudenberg</a> gave an impromptu presentation to a number of people during an early dinner, after the conclusion of the <a href="../../../../../blog/media/events/european-bloggers-conference-friday-recap/index.html">European Bloggers Conference</a>.</p>
<p>I seeded quite a bit at PICNIC with my custom-made <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20955-2/IMG_3360.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[175]">moo.com LinkedIn</a> cards and Marc was one of the lucky recipients but since I did not have enough time to actually get a good talk going, I figured that nothing much would come of it.</p>
<p>For one reason or another however, Marc got back to me and after studying <a href="http://kerimsatirli.com/c/blog/college/page/3/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/kerimsatirli%E2%80%9D">my profile</a> on LinkedIn and approached me to set up a meeting for November 2007. Hah, take that all you <em>nay</em>-sayers who think that LinkedIn cannot be used to get a job!</p>
<p>To be honest, I had no real clue as to what to expect from the talks up-front. Marc seemed to think highly enough of me to devote some of his valuable time to a meeting. I was impressed, plain and simple, but at the same time puzzled, so puzzled that I did not know how to prepare for the meeting and did all I could: learn about all past clients of <em>xolo.tv</em>, create a presentation (yes, just in case) on how they could expand their customer-base and</p>
<p>I had never had a formal interview, mostly because I always gained “access” to a job by sweet-talking my way in, not that there is anything wrong with it, but it is a totally different thing than what happened at <em>xolo.tv</em>.</p>
<p>What impressed, yet at the same time, scared me the most was the warm welcome I received. I burst in during lunch (which just so happened to be a tradition their <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/24688-2/IMG_0413.JPG" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[175]">other intern</a> started) and was invited to join them and grab a bite to eat.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, the talks started where I got a chance to showcase <a href="../../../../../blog/college/cooking-20/index.html">cuizine.tv</a> and was then cross-examined by a number of <em>xolo.tv</em> employees and finally, after receiving a number of interesting and not that easy to answer questions, I was left with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>I knew one thing and that was that I wanted to work there. I also knew that the people working their all are specialists in one way or another and I somehow had to find a reason to convince them, because, frankly, I just had to do this, if not only for the reason that one of the clients was <a href="http://www.blof.nl/">Bløf</a> (yes, it’s true and yes, this was not my main motivation).</p>
<p>During the course of the meeting, Marc expressed his interest in setting up a follow-up meeting for December 2007 and it is safe to say that I was starting to get a good feeling about the whole deal.</p>
<p>The second meeting was much easier-going, basically all we did was sign a few papers and grab some drinks to celebrate, all the while discussing the secrets and intricacies of the female mind - go figure.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>As part of my Bachelor&#8217;s Degree, I am currently doing an internship at <a href="http://media.xolo.tv">xolo.tv</a>, a company that focuses on a number of things that revolve around social media, video production and media sharing.</p>
<p>While the biggest part of my internship consists of actually interning and learning new things, a small part of the whole experience (and a rather big part of the grade) is related to keeping a journal that is accessible to anyone who is interested.</p>
<p>Considering that I am very proud of being able to intern at <em>xolo.tv</em> and at the same time too lazy to set up a new blog, just for the purpose of writing weekly reports, I figured that I might as well post my reports <a href="../../internships/index.html">here</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="post-171"><a href="../../../../../2008/01/16/team-dynamics-and-the-lack-thereof/index.html" rel="bookmark">Team dynamics and the lack thereof</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on January 16th, 2008 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Yesterday marked the conclusion of our most recent project, the current batch of juniors at <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">CMD Breda</a> have now officially concluded the bigger part of their study and can now move on to internships, minors and other awesome stuff.</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the conclusion of nine weeks of hard work and lots of annoyances for just about everyone even remotely involved with our group.</p>
<p>As always, our group consisted of students representing the four different majors our faculty offers and that is where the problems began: traditionally speaking, a faculty like ours always attracts more media designers than technologists, there are generally more interface designers than marketeers / project planners and with projects that rely heavily on the technical side of things and good branding, this, eventually leads to problems.</p>
<p>It is said that the first few meetings of any group are essential. Think of two dogs that meet for the first time - they will sniff each other out, try to gain as much information about the other as they can and then move on. During the next meeting, they will have some sort of idea of what to expect and based on that will either take a friendly or hostile stance towards the other.</p>
<p>This is the very spot where it went wrong for our group. Our first meeting ended in a situation where no one was willing to be the team leader and I can understand that; after all, leading a group of five is no easy job, let alone a group of 32 other students, but in the end, if your major includes the very classes needed to lead a team, namely project management, team building and all, you should at least be capable of taking the helming and steering the group towards a mediocre final product.</p>
<p>Now, do not get me wrong, I am not bitter or harbor any hard feelings, not in the least, but I feel that there is a great number of things that could have, that <em>should</em> have been done better.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with this project is that we worked in teams of 33 people where everyone seemed to have the same voting rights. Democracy is fine and all that, but as long as everyone can veto many things, the outcome of a project will be uncertain.</p>
<p>I believe that, if the project were to have internal representatives that would be allowed to vote (and represent a group of say five or six people) and that those votes were to be considered final, that we would have gotten through the planning / brainstorming stage a lot faster.</p>
<p>Another pet peeve of mine is that our group had little to no regard for application development protocols. I do, of course, realize that with things like this, last-minute changes are part of the whole deal and I would not mind those changes if they were only to fix a bug or two, but if those changes include building new features, days after a feature-freeze has been issued, I get annoyed.</p>
<p>I get even more annoyed when the building of those features results in bugs that kill other, more essential functionality of the main application due to a lack of testing (which was my fault however).</p>
<p>I am a technologist at heart, I suck at designing and I know that, but I try to make up for that lack by knowing just about everything there is to know about the project at hand and I dislike it when people tell me to do things differently when I know that that my solution is going to be used in the end.</p>
<p>One such situation occurred with the building of one of our sub-sites; back in November, I suggested that we include a member registration system, because it would not make sense for everyone to be able to upload data to the site, but I was veto&#8217;ed against. A couple of weeks later, all of a sudden, the request for a member system came in and I had to realize it, long story short: I believe that I understood the way the whole thing would have to be set-up a lot better than those that actually envisioned it.</p>
<p>After weeks of work, much of it being redundant, as in: building features, removing them and rebuilding them, we finally entered the home stretch and with only a couple of days to go, I was confident that we would be able to pull it off (we did!), yet, for one reason or another, it had to be a lot more difficult than it should have been:</p>
<p>Everyone who has ever worked with a live audio / video feed knows that a script is an <em>absolute must</em>, not because I have a hard time remembering things (I do), but because it is essential for everyone involved to know when something is going to happen and how long it is going to last.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the team involved with the live feed begged for a script, yet we did not receive one. Due to the shuffling of the various clips, we could not make our own, yet the team lead had the audacity to complain about the clips not being played out perfectly in the dry-run.</p>
<p>These things simply annoy me to no end and I am happy, very happy that we are finally done with it. I have learned a lot in the past nine weeks: a bit about streaming with the Flash Media Server and the Darwin Server and a whole lot about team dynamics and how the lack thereof can make everything exponentially worse.</p>

		<h2 id="post-158"><a href="../../../../../2007/11/23/cooking-20/index.html" rel="bookmark">Cooking 2.0</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../projects/index.html" title="View all posts in Projects" rel="category tag">Projects</a> on November 23rd, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Back in September, when my junior year in college kicked off, I took a class called &#8220;Backend Development&#8221;, which basically came down to building a clone of a popular video upload / sharing site.</p>
<p>Now, before we start - let me get the technical talk out of the way: the task comprised a number of technologies such as PHP, mySQL, XML, KML (XML used in Google Mapping applications) as well as SOAP, AMFPHP and ActionScript and was basically to be carried out in a two or three man team.</p>
<p>Right from the start, <a href="http://www.kevinvanbeers.com/blog/">Kevin</a> and me knew that we wanted to build a &#8220;real&#8221; application, in the sense of setting up a framework for a (possible) huge portal and even though we did not have the right resources to develop a strong brand identity, we like to think that we managed quite well.</p>
<p>We kept pondering a handful of different themes for our video site and whenever something sounded just good enough to actually be usable, we decided to can it, up until to the point where we nearly ran out of ideas - that is, until I discovered &#8220;a recipe for success&#8221;  (pun intended).</p>
<p>Cooking has long been something I enjoyed and even though I am no real chef and probably never will be, we, that is, Kevin and me, agreed that cooking would be a great theme, so we started developing a site that would later turn into <a href="http://www.cuizine.tv/">cuizine.tv</a>.</p>
<p>cuizine.tv is <em>cooking 2.0</em>, basically enabling you to share and experience different culinary dishes from around the world, all thanks to the power of Flash video.</p>
<p>In the end, from the nine weeks we had available for building the application, we spent most of the time developing a design / conventions document that outlined just about every part of our codebase and associated assets and in the end, I found that a great thing to work with.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that I learned from building this application, it is most probably that good documentation goes a long way and apart from making it easier to identify various parts of the code, it also makes it very easy to extend the application without losing oversight and in the end, our hard work was rewarded with a couple of great grades.</p>
<p>And as always, kudos go out to Kevin Pilasky of <a href="http://qlu.nl/">Qlu New Media</a> for developing a great looking logo. Thanks!</p>

		<h2 id="post-142"><a href="../../../../../2007/09/06/ghosts-from-the-past/index.html" rel="bookmark">Ghosts from the past</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on September 6th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>I went on a little road trip today (well, train trip really) to our capital to deliver a very special package to some people I know and when I came back, I met an old teacher / mentor from my high school and we got into a talk about the past, the present and the future.</p>
<p>Occasionally, it can be really interesting to meet people from the past, especially if those people expressed their doubts (albeit in a very subtle way) about your future before&#8230; this time around however, the cards were stacked in my favor.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not cranky or mad or anything about the behavior of (most of) my former high school teachers, but I find the way the situation has changed kind of amusing.</p>
<p>When I left high school, I set out into an uncertain future, or that&#8217;s what most of my teachers (wanted to?) believe(ed).</p>
<p>I was never really the poster student, nor did I try to be. I have this knack when it comes to learning: I generally only devote my attention to the things that <em>really</em> bother me and my old teacher confirmed that today, stating that I was &#8220;hard to reach&#8221; sometimes and teachers had a hard time &#8220;getting through to me&#8221;.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the day I started my college career, all those things seemed to have vanished. So far, I have had more than 70 different classes and to be honest, I found something that interested me in every single one of them.</p>
<p>Yes, some classes managed to pique my interest a lot more than others, but all in all, I did not have but one subject with which I was unhappy with.</p>
<p>In the end, this probably comes down to the fact that I made a great decision when it comes to college and had the luck of finding a place that teaches just about everything that I am interested in, but still, it is funny how things work out sometimes&#8230;</p>
