	<div class="main">
		<p>For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been working on a <a href="http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/">Battlefield 2</a> based movie. Machinima movies always intrigued me and I wanted to shoot a film in 2006 anyway, so I thought that I might as well combine those two.</p>
<p>During the summer months, I started writing a story about the war some soldiers have to fight during the actual war. Since the movie is based on Battlefield 2, we&#8217;ll have loads of American and Middle Eastern actors and I&#8217;m doing my best to create micro stories around each and every important character. Granted, only five or six of them really are important, but you&#8217;ll probably know a lot more about them by the end of the movie.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not willing to break the story yet, but I wanted to talk about something relating to this movie:</p>
<p>During my first year in <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a>, we spent two weeks in a short-term project called &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221;. The idea behind said project is that the only thing your tutor gives you is a word, no idea, no limits, just a word. Ours was &#8220;waiting room&#8221; and during the two weeks the project lasted, we (a small group of four students) came up with a less than greatly executed solution. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the idea we had really had (and has) potential, but the way we executed it just wasn&#8217;t up to par.</p>
<p>Those two weeks were really the only time during that year I regretted, I didn&#8217;t learn anything (new) and we (all) created tension that, for a certain part, still lingers around and influences current decisions, nine months after &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221; concluded.</p>
<p>This year, I wanted to do something different, I wanted to do something productive and expand my knowledge. Normally, &#8220;FreeSpace&#8221; in the second year links up with a very short internship (of ten working days) at a company that will probably help you make a final decision as to which profile you&#8217;re going to choose for the last two years of your college career. I was really looking forward to that internship and even got in touch with a print shop, because, well, printing stuff, the right way, is something I&#8217;m interested in.</p>
<p>Long story short, we were supposed to have some sort of orientational period this year but it won&#8217;t be an internship - a pity, if you ask me. Then again, I already know what I&#8217;m going to do next year and I don&#8217;t want to waste another two weeks, just to regret them two months from now (FreeSpace is coming up at the end of January 2007).</p>
<p>So, not wanting to waste another two weeks of my short time in college, I decided to put in some work and talk to the man. I <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/lifeofacoder/its-about-how-you-sell-it/bf2_movie_project_pitch_20061211_02_enUS.pdf.html">pitched my idea</a> for the movie in the most business-like way I could imagine and guess what? It worked.</p>
<p>Turns out, the people I pitched my idea to where sold after about the first minute, out of the ten minutes I talked. Apparently, it&#8217;s just about how you sell it and if you do it the right way, your college will even give you permission to play a game and earn some credits with it.</p>
<p>(Naturally, I&#8217;m not just playing a game, I&#8217;m actually writing a scenario, drawing up story boards, locating suitable actors and supporting actors, dabble with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition/">Adobe Audition</a> to clean up the audio, work with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/nl/products/premiere/">Adobe Premiere</a> to cut and edit, use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/">Adobe After Effects</a> to create flashy effects and finalize the whole thing in Flash Video with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/">Adobe Flash</a>.)</p>

		<p>Wow, four weeks without blogging and I hardly noticed. The pace around here is picking up with loads of things to take care of (more on that later).</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m in a heated discussion about how we (the Dutch people) could change the state of mind of homophobic muslims &#8230; everyone has another solution and all of them seem to be more or less pointless. It&#8217;s a difficult audience to cater for and it gets increasingly difficult if you consider that most of this phobia is based on religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Luckily I got a little bit more time now, classes finished and I&#8217;ve got some 30 minutes to blog about stuff that&#8217;s been on my mind:</p>
<p>A few weeks <a href="../../../../blog/media/jericho-isnt-just-a-town-in-the-west-bank/index.html">ago</a> I talked about a new show on CBS called Jericho. We&#8217;re nearing the mid-season break now and it turned out that it&#8217;s one, if not the best show of the current season. Characters are developed in a very interesting way, the directors add the complimentary conspiracy theories and the show&#8217;s web conduit(s) are great to experience too. CBS is certainly on the right path to creating a show that&#8217;s a lot more immersive than shows were a season ago.</p>
<p>Other than watching kick-ass TV shows, I&#8217;ve also spent some more time <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/opendag_06/">promoting</a> my <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a> and while having a great time with co-students, I also met some future-students who even remembered me (and whom I didn&#8217;t remember, shame on me).</p>
<p>Tonight I&#8217;ll be attending the first Next Night, powered, conceived and executed by <a href="http://generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a>, a group of young students who decided that the time was right to set up &#8220;venue&#8221; where we all could meet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be blogging more about that later tonight&#8230;</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>Ten days ago, I <a href="../../../../blog/college/can-i-help-you-with-anything/index.html">attended</a> an edu-fair as a student advisor. Thinking back, it was probably one of the most interesting experiences I had while performing any job I had so far. The team was great, the aura was great and we had lots of fun. In essence, that&#8217;s all you need to have a <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/">good time</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I attended another edu-fair, again, as a student advisor and I was actually looking forward to it. I was hoping that we could top the amount of fun we had last time, help more people and get to know some more people, but alas - the experience was rather &#8230; disappointing.</p>
<p>A few years ago, back when I was about to decide which college to go to, my options were a <a href="http://www.stjoost.nl/">purely artistic college</a> and a rather <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">young college</a>, with courses focussed towards communication and multimedia design.</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t really see myself as an &#8220;analogue artist&#8221; but rather a digital one, I opted for the second one. Sometimes I think back, how it could have been. After all, the first mentioned college trained some of the Netherlands most famous artists and to be allowed to join those ranks would be something great certainly. Either way, I don&#8217;t regret my decision and I&#8217;m proud to be a &#8220;CMD student&#8221;.</p>
<p>Back on topic, yesterday I got my first chance to talk to a tutor from the artists college and gosh &#8230; that lady has some serious issues. Sure, their college is great, many great people graduated there, but I don&#8217;t personally consider that a reason to rant about other colleges. No matter if they&#8217;re part of your own college group (like my college) or not.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t do it, a few of them being that it is immature, very unprofessional and that it&#8217;s just plain wrong, yet that tutor decided that her college was better than others and felt obligated to carry out her verbal battle with me in front of a possible future student. She went on about how students from my college are less artistic and less creative and how their students are the true Picassos, Van Goghs etc.</p>
<p>I discussed this issue with a few students (from my college) and all of them agree that her behaviour was plain wrong. I personally think that the student in question wont join us next year, after all - the first impression he got from our school was that we like to bitch.</p>
<p>Now, if that lady decides to rave about her own college, I&#8217;d like her to go right ahead, but she shouldn&#8217;t do it at the cost of our, or any other college, for that matter.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, their stand was also the only one that didn&#8217;t fit the CI of our 9 other stands. She decided that their stand deserved loads of posters and empty soda cans on the table, even though we were told to make sure that all stands looked as clean and inviting as possible at any time during the fair.</p>
<p>That said, all in all the fair was less disappointing than that incident but still not great. Most people weren&#8217;t really motivated to promote their courses in an interesting way and I&#8217;m quite sure that most people interested in our college were getting a totally wrong impression.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re one of the people who stopped by yesterday and think that our college isn&#8217;t really &#8220;gezellig&#8221; and just blows, I apologize. Feel free to come to one of our walk-in days, for example the one on November 18th, 2006. We&#8217;ll be present with a great team from 10 am till 3 pm and you&#8217;ll  be able to experience our &#8220;chemistry&#8221;.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>a person approaches the stand I share with three other guys, he&#8217;s looking at our folders, afraid to make eye contact with anyone of us. It&#8217;s obvious - he wants information but is afraid to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there, can I help you with anything?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how most conversations this weekend started. No, I wasn&#8217;t trying to sell the new VA-QUME CleanR, I was actually promoting computer sciences and especially my own <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">faculty</a> on the first <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/dag_1/IMG_0451.JPG.html">trade fair</a> targeted towards future students who are looking for a way to gather as much information about their possible college in as little time as possible.</p>
<p>To be honest, before I went there, I was a little bit afraid. I don&#8217;t really have a problem talking to people from my college, not even if I never met them, but it&#8217;s a different game if you&#8217;re talking to absolute strangers. After all, you have to deal with a myriad of situations and attitudes. Whereas one person addresses you in the most formal way possible, someone else might be talking you down, for no apparent reason. However, to prepare for such situations, we were given the chance to follow a training session which included roleplays where you could practice difficult to handle situations.</p>
<p>After two days of standing there, pitching my college and helping loads of people (all our teams together gathered some 1400 addresses in just 14 hours (two days of seven hours each) - which, as I was told, is quite a lot.</p>
<p>When the first day ended, two other <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/dag_1/IMG_0461.JPG.html">Comp Sci guys</a> (second and third one from the left) and me decided to have a few drinks and get some chow and we all came to the conclusion that it was a blast.</p>
<p>Normally you&#8217;d argue that standing behind a small stand is bad for your mood, even boring &#8230; but no, it was great. I loved every second of it! Others totally <a href="http://www.inmyvision.net/?item=kan-ik-je-ergens-mee-helpen">agree</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever I had time, I took a few shots here and there. Way too many, as always, but hey - pictures, often, say a lot more than words. Many of the lovely ladies and funny guys can be seen in the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/">gallery</a> - comments are open, so share your thoughts!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to end this entry with a quick &#8220;thank you&#8221; note to <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/dag_2/IMG_0664.JPG.html">all the students that helped</a> in one way or another and kudos to <a href="http://www.inmyvision.net/">Jack</a> for hooking me up with a spare SD card so I could continue taking pictures.</p>

		<p>A few hours ago I returned from my first CMD (my college) party - basically a themed party made by and for students from my faculty. &#8220;themed&#8221; is really the keyword here - the topic of yesterday&#8217;s party was &#8220;the Eighties&#8221; and I kinda managed to miss that little fact completely.</p>
<p>Still, the party was awesome, even though I only spotted like three or four freshmen, which is odd, considering that this, first, party was organized especially for freshmen, to make it easier for them to get in touch with sophomores, middlers, juniors and seniors and probably even alumni.</p>
<p>The producers planned out a karaoke event which was fun to listen to and I&#8217;d even taken part, but somehow no one I talked to had the guts to get up on stage and embarrass themselves in front of an audience that was just shy of 120 people. Too bad, maybe better luck next time?</p>
<p>Kudos go out to <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/feest_0906/_MG_371.jpg.html">Geoffrey</a> who hooked me up with a place to crash (which we both did, quite literally) after the party.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;re still reading and want to get a better impression of the whole party, head over to my <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/">gallery</a> and check out the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/feest_0906/">party album</a></p>
