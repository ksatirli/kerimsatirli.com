	<div class="main">
		<p>I just came across a clip on YouTube that I felt was worth posting about. The clip has been viewed close to 500,000 times already and as always, this kind of attention also attracts those that <em>try</em> to take the high road by claiming that they would never do the things depicted in the video.</p>
<p>Now, before you get any wrong ideas about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LPvC2Mb59w">the clip</a>, rest assured, its mostly safe for work. There&#8217;s no nudity or anything, in fact - its nothing more than a visualization of human nature:</p>
<p>Paul Robinett, director and producer of the clip is taping his son, who has been trying to bury himself under the sand, when all of a sudden, Robinett spots a trio of young women:</p>
<p>Now, beautiful women on a beautiful beach aren&#8217;t that uncommon these days, so what&#8217;s the fuss about you might wonder? Well, instead of stopping the tape or focusing on his son again, Robinett keeps taping the women, in order to point out that his actions (watching them) aren&#8217;t all that bad, considering that the trio is doing exactly the same, namely watching a handsome lifeguard and even having the guts of walking in front of the lifeguard in order to take a few pictures with him standing in the background.</p>
<p>So, I am wondering, how is it that it is acceptable for women to watch men and yet, at the same time, it is socially unacceptable for men to watch women?</p>
<p>As expected, this video gathered quite a few <a href="http://www.youtube.com/video_response_view_all?v=5LPvC2Mb59w">responses</a>, with some of them complaining about the content of the video and others congratulating Robinett for being courageous enough to post this kind of clip on YouTube.</p>
<p>My take on this video is simple: Robinett has a point and a very good one at that. It is simply human nature to seek out the more attractive members of a society and there is nothing wrong with that and even more, that is nothing to feel guilty about.</p>
<p>Robinett does not portray these women as sex objects in any way, he only shows the viewer that females <em>do not</em> differ from males as much as socially accepted values would lead us to believe.</p>

		<p>Google just stealth-launched a new service (beta, naturally) in the Americas called AdSense for mobile. The service has already been tested for about 15 months now in Japan and was deemed successful enough to roll it out to a broader public.</p>
<p>While I am not a huge fan of advertising in general, I believe that the monetary reward that a publisher can get from services like AdSense can be beneficial to the end user as far as making content freely available goes.</p>
<p>If Google enforces the same guidelines as it does with &#8220;normal&#8221; AdSense, I believe that this will be a great way to provide mobile users with content free of charge, while at the same time being able to monetize those same visitors.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>Hot on the heels of Fast Company&#8217;s announcement about <a href="../../../../../blog/media/fast-cities-2007/index.html">Fast Cities</a> and the lack thereof as far as Europe goes, Saul Klein and Reshma Sohoni announced their newest initiative called <a href="http://www.seedcamp.com/">Seedcamp</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/07/launching-seedcamp.html">Klein</a>&#8217;s vision is simple:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re looking for the brightest and the best young entrepreneurs across Europe, Middle East and Africa to blow us away with their ideas for game-changing businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s even better is that Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten, of <a href="../../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-recap/index.html">The Next Web</a> fame, decided to <a href="http://bomega.com/2007/07/12/seedcamp/">provide some additional exposure</a> to two of the selected Seedcamp teams.</p>
<p>Watch out Fast Company, next year, Europe will most certainly have a lot more to show than we did this year.</p>

		<p>In today&#8217;s highly linked world, one might say that the geographical location of a business does not matter anymore, after all, the Internet lets you work with anyone, anytime anywhere, right?. Wrong, businesses still depend on good locations and there are people out their that want you to help with finding the right one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a>, just published their <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/cities/2007/">2007 listing</a> of <em>Fast Cities</em>. The list is essentially a guide on great (perfect?) places to start your new business:</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re smart, young, newly graduated from a university with the whole world before you. You could settle in a small town with well-tended lawns, pancake suppers, and life on a human scale. Or you could truck it to the big city, with all its din and dog-eat-dog lunacy. Your choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>While the list in itself is pretty interesting and contains good advice on the various hot spots, I wonder why so few European cities and especially not one Dutch city made the cut.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a kind <a href="../../../../../blog/media/events/the-next-web-2007-morning-recap/index.html">fright</a> amongst European companies as far as innovation and great business ideas go, but still, we aren&#8217;t doing <em>that</em> bad, are we?</p>
<p>Microsoft choose to beta test their <a href="http://www.live.com/">Live</a> service in the Netherlands first. Why? Because we have the highest broadband penetration in the whole western world.</p>
<p>Whenever you check out new technology, there is some kind of Dutch influence. Be i that we helped produce the product, helped support it or just am the nation with the most users of said product.</p>
<p>We might not always come in first, but we surely are not the last ones to finish, so why are we not on the Fast City listing?</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on June 8th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>The first edition of The Next Web conference featured an after-party that was held at Boris‚Äô private residence in the heart of Amsterdam, five minutes from the venue where the conference was held. While I‚Äôm certain that Boris could have rented a huge party area, I loved the fact that he managed to keep the whole thing on a very social level. Basically, it was like meeting some old friends for a quick beer after work. Only difference to a normal ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù was that those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were specialists and gurus such as Kevin Kelly, AMS-IX and mabber.com representatives, among many others. The personal aspect, combined with a location that provided users with four (geographical) areas to hold conversations, proved most useful for networking purposes.</p>
<p>This year, Boris decided to rent the famous club / restaurant / all-round great place Odeon, one of Amsterdam‚Äôs hottest bars and the main location of the 2006 after party. Great move on Boris part, ‚Äòcause it prevented the group from breaking up too soon. Out of the approximately 500 people that attended the conference, some 150 showed up for the Dinner at the Odeon and, after some small talk, enjoyed a great dinner, with each other.</p>
<p>Prior to the actual dinner, I came across Marjolijn van den Assem, Boris mother and engaged her in a conversation about the conference and the day‚Äôs events. Even though van den Assem isn‚Äôt your typical Web 2.0 conference attendee, it was obvious that she really paid close attention to what the speakers at the conference talked about.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, I managed to get a seat at the Veldhuijzen van Zanten table that was a bit more secluded that the rest and provided a great environment for interesting talk. I happened to know van den Assem from Boris <a href=http://www.bomega.com/>blog</a> and I have to say that I haven‚Äôt had such an interesting conversation in a long time. As a person who is deeply interested in Nietzsche, van den Assem devoted the last 30 years of her life to studying the teachings of the scientist. Her work was recently published in a book called ‚ÄúSeelenbriefe‚Äù.</p>
<p>Talking to van den Assem is a cleansing experience; she, unlike others, really listens to what you have to say and isn‚Äôt afraid to share her own experiences with you, basically, this is all you need to keep a conversation going for a long time.</p>
<p>Then, at 8 pm, Veldhuijzen van Zanten kicked off the <a href="http://awards.thenextweb.org/">The Next Web 2007 Awards</a> show. The whole experience was great, especially because I got to accept an award that was actually destined for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Jimbo, apparently, could not make it to the show, so they picked the next best guy, <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/20252-1/531238157_a8d31ee66d_b.jpg" class="lightwindow" rel="lightbox[87]">me</a> (make sure to click on that link, it really is worth it!).</p>
<p>After a great Awards show, the real after-party started, but I will let <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/events/thenextweb_07/">the photographs</a> speak for themselves.</p>
<p>All in all, <em>The Next Web 2007</em> was as great as the 2006 edition, if not even greater. I learned a lot, met a lot of interesting people and had an awesome time.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations Boris (and crew) for managing to set up something as kick-ass as this.</p>
