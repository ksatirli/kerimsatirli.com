		<description>John,

thank you for your contribution. I just looked into Kerio Mailserver and it looks quite interesting to me and it is, indeed, a lot cheaper than Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, however, since we invested both time and money in a Zarafa license, I don't see myself switching to any other solution in the short run.

Nonetheless, Kerio sounds especially good as far as "out of the box" experience goes, although, one does wonder: does it work out of the box with Plesk too?</description>

		<description>You should check out Kerio MailServer. It runs on Mac/Windows/Linux. I just moved it over to CentOS from Fedora. Installation and upgrades are a breeze. You'll get Exchange level features for Outlook, mobile, web working right out of the box. As a bonus, you'll also get appliance level spam and virus protection, archiving and backup. The server has been rock solid for us for the last few years, maintenance free and a whole lot cheaper than Exchange.</description>
