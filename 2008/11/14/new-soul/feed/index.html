		<description>Kay,

apologies for the tardy response. 

The MacBook pro has worked out perfectly so far, I have not ever looked back (well, except for gaming maybe, which works just fine in Bootcamp) and I have come to appreciate how much thought Apple puts into designing software and hardware that works, no matter what.</description>

		<description>This post just described what happened to me this morning.  My 3 yr. old Tecra M4 just blew it's graphics card and faced with the task of doing all my blogging and coding on my EEE PC is already making my eyes and hands ache.

The Tablet PC experience didn't live up to my expectations and now I'm looking for a normal laptop this time around.  

How has your MacBook Pro been working out for you?</description>
