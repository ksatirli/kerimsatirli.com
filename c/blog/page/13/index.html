		<p>Once again, Mediamatic and a huge number of partners are holding a &#8220;festival for geeks, marketeers, bloggers, web 2.0 aficionados and the likes&#8221; - yes, <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/">PICNIC&#8217;07</a> has officially started.</p>
<p>PICNIC&#8217;06 was great and everyone who went there loved every single minute of it so it only makes sense that many of last year&#8217;s visitors will be taking part again this year.</p>
<p>PICNIC&#8217;07 features great speakers, great opportunities for networking and, certainly, great experiences and while I would love to attend the whole week, including the most awesome <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/artefact-10330-en.html">Red Bull Soundclash</a>, I still have to go to <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a> every now and then, so I decided to only attend one, event:</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/artefact-5686-en.html">European Bloggers Conference</a> - a session that will focus on topics such as <em>how and when citizen journalism works</em> and <em>how one can build successful web 2.0 applications</em>. Apart from interesting information, this unconference will definitely spark some interesting discussions and I am hoping to gain some new insight into the workings of the blogosphere.</p>
<p>So, <em>uncork your brain</em> and if you are in the <a href="http://www.amsterdam.com/">city</a>, stop by the Westergasfabriek for some cross media-enlightenment.</p>

		<h2 id="post-148"><a href="../../../../2007/09/25/tv-season-2007-2008/index.html" rel="bookmark">TV Season 2007 / 2008</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../media/index.html" title="View all posts in Media" rel="category tag">Media</a> on September 25th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>The summer is (finally) coming to an end and the only show worth watching during the summer break, <a href="http://www.scifi.com/eureka/">Eureka</a> only has another two episodes left before it, too, goes on hiatus (with no word on a possible third season yet).</p>
<p>Fret not though, for all is not lost: the third (and fourth) week of September generally marks the beginning of the Fall season for TV shows and therefore also means that a number of great series will either start or continue.</p>
<p>Last year around, I only really discussed one show, <a href="../../../../blog/media/jericho-isnt-just-a-town-in-the-west-bank/index.html">Jericho</a>, which, incidentally will return for a second season, sometime mid-season - which can be anywhere from November to March.</p>
<p>Jericho was first canceled and then renewed only a couple of days later, thanks to the doing of many, many fans that kept sending nuts (an insider reference to the last episode) to <a href="http://www.cbs.com/">CBS</a>, Jericho&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>If you have never seen Jericho, I suggest you either try to catch the re-runs, or grab yourself the <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/B000SQFC2C/">DVD</a>; in any case, you will not regret me exposing (yes, another insider reference) you to this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Wars around the globe</strong></p>
<p>Last May, <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/the_unit/">The Unit</a>, another CBS hit show, concluded with a breathtaking finale that left more than a handful of questions open. Tonight, September 25th, the third season&#8217;s premiere will start answering a couple of these questions.</p>
<p>The best way I can classify <em>The Unit</em> is by calling it a military-social-drama, which means that there is a lot of shooting, some killing, a couple of nice explosions, <a href="../../../../blog/media/three-great-songs-you-should-listen-to/index.html">a <em>great</em> song</a> and of course the really dangerous things, these elite soldiers face: the home-front which consist of adultery, lies and other niceties.</p>
<p><strong>Save the cheerleader &#8230; then what?</strong></p>
<p>NBC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/">Heroes</a> was one of the most successful series last year, with an approximate 14 million viewers during the premiere as well as a place in the &#8220;Top 10 TV Shows of 2006&#8243; ballot from the American Film Institute.</p>
<p>The second season kicked off yesterday and continues where the first season left off - in feudal Japan and although I could give you a synopsis of the first episode, it is best not to spoil anything. Heroes, simply is too great a work of (modern day filming) art to not experience it on your own time.</p>
<p>On a related note: close to the end of the 2007 / 2008 season, Heroes: Origins will premiere, which will feature six episodes, with one new <em>hero</em> in every episode, at the end of the mini-series, viewers will get to vote which will be allowed to return in a third season.</p>
<p><strong>From Stargate to Atlantis</strong></p>
<p>On September 28th, this Friday, the SciFi channel will premiere the fourth season of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/atlantis">Stargate: Atlantis</a> and for the first time, this will be the only Stargate franchise that will kick-off at that day.</p>
<p>Season 10 of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/stargate">Stargate</a> was concluded last May, after more than 200 episodes, which, incidentally, made it the longest running science fiction show, just a few episodes ahead of <em>The X - Files</em>.</p>
<p>The new season will bring a number of changes, such as one of the main characters from Atlantis giving up her job and another main character from Stargate: SG1 taking up her place. Apart from that, the fourth season will also feature the return of crowd-favorite Dr. Beckett, who passed away in the latter half of the third season.</p>
<p>The great thing with scifi is that you can, one way or another, revive people and while there were no plans to bring back Beckett at first, fans of the show around the world <a href="http://www.savecarsonbeckett.com/">united</a> in order to bring back the <em>heart of Atlantis</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Interns and Relationships</strong></p>
<p>Apart from Stargate: Atlantis, <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/">Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</a> will also start it&#8217;s fourth season this Thursday, September 28th, which, too, will answer a great number of open questions on the status of the various relationships between, among and across the various actors.</p>
<p>One day prior, Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8217;s spin-off <a href="http://abc.go.com/fallpreview/privatepractice/index?u=0">Private Practice</a> will start its 13 episode season. The show will focus on the life of one Dr. Montgomery after she left Seattle Grace Hospital and heads down to the Los Angeles area in order to, well, join a private practice.</p>
<p><strong>Shanks and Shackles</strong></p>
<p>While not as good as all-time favorite prison show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118421/">Oz</a> in my opinion, Fox&#8217; <a href="http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/">Prison Break</a> just kicked off its third season a week ago and once again tells the story of two brothers who &#8220;got each others backs in times of need&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the first two season took place mostly in the North American part of this world, the third season features a plot in Panama with a selection of new threats, new fish and questionable alliances.</p>
<p><strong>The (silent) clock</strong></p>
<p>Much later this season, January 13th, 2008 to be precise - everyone&#8217;s favorite counter-terrorist Jack Bauer will return for season 7 of <a href="http://fox.com/24/">24</a>. Contrary, however, to the previous six season, Bauer will not be the same &#8220;guy&#8221; anymore; Season 7 will be very different to what we have grown accustomed too and will feature a much darker plot.</p>
<p>It is expected that season 7 will introduce a (number of) plot(s) that will be concluded during the eight season, which is as far as Fox went with pre-ordering new episodes.</p>
<p><strong>3, 2, 1 &#8230; cut!</strong></p>
<p>All the above shows have been hand-picked by me, they represent my personal taste and my personal taste only. The shows range from drama to action to thrillers to science fiction and the only thing they really do have in common is that they all provide a great source of entertainment.</p>
<p>Not all of the above mentioned shows are safe for young children, so make sure you know what your kids are watching.</p>
<p><ins datetime="2007-09-26T22:15:36+00:00">[UPDATE]</ins></p>
<p>For those that are curious, <em>The Unit</em>&#8217;s new theme song is called <em>Walk the Fire</em>, by Robert Duncan, the guy who also made the theme for the first two seasons. Both tracks are available for listening at Robert Duncan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.myspace.com/robertduncan">MySpace</a> page.</p>
<p><ins datetime="2007-10-03T17:59:47+00:00">[UPDATE #2]</ins></p>
<p>I just came across <a href="http://www.visiteureka.net/news.html?nid=152">this bit</a> on the premier Eureka fansite <a href="http://www.visiteureka.net/">VisitEureka.net</a> that states:</p>
<blockquote><p>SCI FI Channel has greenlit production on a third season of its most-watched Original Series Eureka, ordering 13 new hours of the dramedy.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, come summer 2008, Eureka will be returning for a third season, <em>yay</em> for that.</p>

		<p>When I first met <a href="http://nsnelson.wordpress.com/">Nate</a>, I knew that I had found one of those rare people you have an immediate link with; you share the same thoughts at the same time and it starts to become magical.</p>
<p>Nate and I are both passionate about what we do, what we have done and what we will be doing and we agreed that it was time to start doing something together and so we started to work on <a href="http://www.nachotalk.com/">NachoTalk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>NachoTalk is a blog that focuses on social and cultural commentary, with viewpoints from two writers on opposite sides of the Atlantic (hence the tagline). We also may occasionally stray from that that formula and post something a little more lighthearted than the usual topics.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nate and I both started writing articles a couple of weeks ago and decided that the best way to handle things was to go for a two-weekly schedule; one week Nate publishes an article, the next week I do and so on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nachotalk.com/i-aint-no-millionaires-son">Our first</a> contributions <a href="http://www.nachotalk.com/we-dont-need-no-education">are online</a>, so feel free to hop over and enjoy our new project.</p>
<p>That said, thanks go out to Kevin, <a href="http://www.benreedy.com/">Ben</a>, Phillip, <a href="http://unikoeln.facebook.com/profile.php?id=245700020">Emma</a>, <a href="http://www.mattersofconversation.com/">Gabriele</a>, Joel, <a href="http://brocku.facebook.com/profile.php?id=89906160">Katie</a>, <a href="http://svagis.wordpress.com/">Darren</a> and a couple of others for providing us with feedback during our soft-launch period, you rock guys (and gals, of course).</p>

		<p>Avast me landlubbin&#8217; rats, t&#8217;is that time of the year again arrrr. Yes matey, September 19th is <a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com">Talk Like a Pirate day</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="../../../../blog/projects/techy-shirts-catchy-slogans-and-pirates/index.html">last year</a>, I actually (very last-minute) created a shirt to commemorate this <em>very important</em> event, only to find out that I wasn&#8217;t getting much chance at wearing it today because I had a day off.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, it is good to see that TLAP day has cast its wave across the web like a new schooner would:</p>
<p>The <del datetime="2007-09-19T16:11:32+00:00">guys</del> pirates at Iliumsoft are giving you a chance at getting 50% off of <em>any</em> title if you dare to call and speak like a real pirate, arrrrrr!</p>
<p>The land lubbers at CrunchGear are giving you a chance at <a href="http://crunchgear.com/2007/09/19/talk-like-a-pirate-win-2gb-ram/">winning 2GB of RAM</a>, again, for talking like a pirate.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world is simply enjoying the day &#8230;</p>
<p>In case you have not gotten your pirattitude on, head on over to the official TLAP page for some information on <a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com/howto.html">how to pronounce words</a> like a real sword buckler.</p>
<p>The TLAP team also created a nice video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/2cKCkbWDGwE" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Talk like a Pirate Day!">the 5 As every pirate should remember</a> and a funnny <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/AM1NUGlo2ww" class="lightwindow page-options" params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" title="YouTube: Talk like a Pirate Day Song">song</a>.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>It is said that, to adequately express one&#8217;s feelings or opinion for any given subject, one must posses an elaborate vocabulary and what do you know. With anywhere between close to 450,000 and even up to a staggering 980,000 words, the English language has one of the richest, if not <em>the</em> vocabulary of all languages.</p>
<p>All those words, however meaningful or meaningless, hurting or caring, sweet or sour, apparently do not make for good company: Recent studies conducted across many Western Nations, including both English speakers and natives of other tongues, came to the conclusion that, based on the input the researchers received, people with a native background in English are less happy than people that were raised to speak another language.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, most of these studies showed that French native speakers always came out as one of the happiest groups and one might wonder how that can be, after all, French is said to contain a mere 100,000 words.</p>
<p>It would seem that the more basic a language gets, the happier its speakers become and this is certainly true for those people that truly embrace a language called <em>Toki Pona</em>. With only some 118 words at your disposal, many things simply stop mattering.</p>
<p><em>Toki Pona</em> however, is not the only language that can have a soothing and calming effect on one&#8217;s psyche. There are a great many artificial languages out there that were made to let you talk, listen and live in a more simplistic way and in fact, many parts of concept of Taoism are built around these very beliefs. </p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, many people, particularly those living in Western nations believe that (inner) bliss can only be achieved by having the latest gadgets, an expensive car, going on numerous butt-kicking vacations (with or without your family) and we can&#8217;t really forget jewelry, lots of it oh - and expensive clothes, shoes, maybe throw in a few plastic / corrective surgeries for good measure?</p>
<p>Do not get me wrong; I do not dislike stylish clothes or shoes and out-of-the-ordinary vacations or expensive gadgets, in fact, many people can at least attest to the last one, but still, at the end of the day, those things are not what make me really happy, they are means to an end; simply getting there &#8230; a place called bliss.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s definition of that place is probably different and one person might find it harder to get there than others, but do not let yourself be put off by some problems along the road - because when you are running out of game, <em>nothing</em> is more satisfying than being able to look back on a satisfying life. </p>
<p>In fact, many current printed publications, especially the ones aimed at women looking for &#8220;an easy way to tune out and relax with some trivial stories about stars no one really cares about anymore&#8221; talk about the power of positive thinking and while the larger part of them eschews the actual essence of that theory, they are at least managing to get people excited about the concept.</p>
<p>In the end, it all comes down to your mindset, success can not only be bred and inherited, but also be thought up. It is as simple as believing in yourself. It does wonders for your self esteem and that can, and actually does, make all the difference.</p>
<p>People with a high confidence rating are more likely to go out and do something crazy and ever so often, one of those crazy things pays off. After all, those that try, succeed, eventually. Yes, some manage to hit it big sooner rather than later, but in the end, success is inevitable. </p>
<p>Luck does not only favor the prepared, but also the bold - go out and rid yourself of the chains that are mass-consumption and you will be rewarded.</p>
<p>But I digress, back to <em>Toki Pona</em>, I realize that the language is, not at all, suitable for widespread, business use, but it is certainly very well suited for recreational and spiritual use and may offer you guidance in a way you thought impossible before.</p>
<p>The next time you feel sad or spent, pause for a minute and think about the situation you are in. Is it really as bad as you are imagining it or are you panicking and blowing things out of proportion? Bad things happen all the time, it is the way you deal with it that defines <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> you are. </p>
<p>Well, the only thing that is left to say now is: <em>mi wile sina jo pona tenpo</em>.</p>
