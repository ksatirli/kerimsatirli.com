		<description>Love consumes cycles and blocks, therefore a servers most prudent course of action would be to file anything that does not "free up" or "expand" its resources to "inappropriate".

Love is messy and sloppy and expansive and contractive. And a huge part of writing the book that is your life. Without it, what is life, at a human beings' level of sentience? If you can write a reply longer than three words, without the words "but", "human", "heart", "mind", or "substance" you've spent more than 46 1/2 seconds on it, and I may give it some thought.</description>
