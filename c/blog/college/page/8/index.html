		<p>a person approaches the stand I share with three other guys, he&#8217;s looking at our folders, afraid to make eye contact with anyone of us. It&#8217;s obvious - he wants information but is afraid to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there, can I help you with anything?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how most conversations this weekend started. No, I wasn&#8217;t trying to sell the new VA-QUME CleanR, I was actually promoting computer sciences and especially my own <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">faculty</a> on the first <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/dag_1/IMG_0451.JPG.html">trade fair</a> targeted towards future students who are looking for a way to gather as much information about their possible college in as little time as possible.</p>
<p>To be honest, before I went there, I was a little bit afraid. I don&#8217;t really have a problem talking to people from my college, not even if I never met them, but it&#8217;s a different game if you&#8217;re talking to absolute strangers. After all, you have to deal with a myriad of situations and attitudes. Whereas one person addresses you in the most formal way possible, someone else might be talking you down, for no apparent reason. However, to prepare for such situations, we were given the chance to follow a training session which included roleplays where you could practice difficult to handle situations.</p>
<p>After two days of standing there, pitching my college and helping loads of people (all our teams together gathered some 1400 addresses in just 14 hours (two days of seven hours each) - which, as I was told, is quite a lot.</p>
<p>When the first day ended, two other <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/dag_1/IMG_0461.JPG.html">Comp Sci guys</a> (second and third one from the left) and me decided to have a few drinks and get some chow and we all came to the conclusion that it was a blast.</p>
<p>Normally you&#8217;d argue that standing behind a small stand is bad for your mood, even boring &#8230; but no, it was great. I loved every second of it! Others totally <a href="http://www.inmyvision.net/?item=kan-ik-je-ergens-mee-helpen">agree</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever I had time, I took a few shots here and there. Way too many, as always, but hey - pictures, often, say a lot more than words. Many of the lovely ladies and funny guys can be seen in the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/">gallery</a> - comments are open, so share your thoughts!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to end this entry with a quick &#8220;thank you&#8221; note to <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/onderwijsbeurs_06/dag_2/IMG_0664.JPG.html">all the students that helped</a> in one way or another and kudos to <a href="http://www.inmyvision.net/">Jack</a> for hooking me up with a spare SD card so I could continue taking pictures.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../../personal-stuff/index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on September 25th, 2006 </div>

		<p>The following text is part of a presentation I&#8217;m scheduled to give in a few hours. The assignment was to discuss a topic of our choosing, for example a book, political issue, a charity and get the listeners to take action.</p>
<p>I decided to go with &#8220;What is Identity?&#8221; as the topic, mainly because I think that identity plays a very important role in our lives, yet most people never stop to think about &#8220;identity&#8221; or the effect it has on a society.</p>
<p>FYI: the first reference I make is in regards of a presentation I gave a few days ago. The topic was the Dutch PM J. P. Balkenende and as part of my assignment I discussed his personal life and his identity. Hope that clears things up a little.</p>
<p>The presenation is available as a PDF file <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/10461-5/what_is_identity_2006092501.pdf">here</a>, an updated version is available <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/10469-3/what_is_identity_2006092502.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #0]</span><br />
Good afternoon ladies and gentleman, today I&#8217;m _NOT_ gonna discuss anything relating to politics, but rather something entirely different. Last week, as most of you will remember, we discussed <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #1]</span> the identity of the Dutch PM, today <span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span> today I&#8217;m <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #2]</span> gonna talk about identity and I&#8217;ll try to explain <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #3]</span> what it really is.</p>
<p>Before we start out with the presentation, I&#8217;d like to explain that there is not <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #4]</span> just one form of identity, but rather half a dozen, well <span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span>, that count anyway.</p>
<p>So first of all there&#8217;s <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #5]</span> personal identity, it basically defines who you are. Then there&#8217;s <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #6]</span> the psychological identity, which truly defines who you are and what makes you unique. Those two are an essential part of your social <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #7]</span> identity. <span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span> next we have the <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #8]</span> cultural identity, which defines your identity within a group of people. It may also influence your <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #9]</span> online identity, which of course is part of your <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #10]</span> digital identity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 2]</span></p>
<p>As you can see, there are many forms of <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #11]</span> identity and to keep things from getting too complicated, I&#8217;ll just discuss one of the above mentioned - <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #12]</span> the personal identity. <span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span> As the name suggests, the personal identity defines who you are, it tells others who you are and it stands for what <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #13]</span> makes you you.</p>
<p>When I asked a colleague of mine what identity meant to her, she responded that personal identity was synonymous with characteristics to her. I beg to differ. While the person I spoke to is right as that characteristics form a part of our identity, she confused the &#8220;social identity&#8221; with &#8220;personal identity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: Think of two guys, both have <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #14]</span> brown hair, it&#8217;s even <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #15]</span> short. They both have grey <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #16]</span> eyes and they&#8217;re medium <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #17]</span> tall. <span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span> Would you say the guys are <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #18]</span> identical, based on these characteristics? She did and I hope you wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>A personal <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #19]</span> identity is a lot more than just looks, it defines who <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #20]</span> you are, what you <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #21]</span> are and what you could <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #22]</span> have been.</p>
<p><span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span> To be perfectly honest, you could think about this for hours on end and not come to a conclusive answer, trust me, I tried. So why am I bothering you with this?</p>
<p><span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span> Basically, what I want you to do is to take a break sometime today, tomorrow, whenever you feel like it, sit back, try to focus on your being. Not your soul, but rather your &#8230; character, your &#8230; &#8220;you&#8221;. Think about what you are, more importantly who you are, how you came to be the person that you are and what you think you could be <span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span>. Then, think some more &#8230; try to find out how you can be the person you could be, think about what you have to do to get there. Then forget about it.<span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #23]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE 1]</span> Sure, it&#8217;s important to think about the future, about possible ways it all could have been; <span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #24]</span> You could have been born 50 years ago, maybe even a hundred, you could be born in ten years, you could have been a a girl or a boy. It all really doesn&#8217;t matter. What matters is that you accept who you are. _Be_ content with what you are, who you are. Don&#8217;t frown about things you have no control over, but rather accept that you already are a great person.</p>
<p>If you can manage that, you have reached a level of selfrespect, maybe even bliss, that most people never reach. Congratulations, you&#8217;re now a lot more unique than before.</p>
<hr />
<p>The red, green and blue tags you&#8217;re seeing are something I came up with about a year ago. I call it PPML - the PowerPoint Markup Language. Basically it&#8217;s a way of writing a text and working the important events of your presentation into it. I&#8217;ve bee using it for about five presentations so far and to be honest, it rocks. It makes presenting a whole lot easier, not only for me, but also for any assistant who is helping out with switching slides and stuff.</p>
<p>During the last presentations, I came up with a few tags, stuff that is easy to remember and easy to spot (especially if you color code it).</p>
<p><span style="color: #f00; font-weight:bold;">[SLIDE #X]</span> - basically tells you (your assistant) that the next slide should be displayed now. &#8220;X&#8221; here stands for any number. My first slide is always empty (so as to not give away the topic too early) and as such it&#8217;s #0.</p>
<p><span style="color: #00f; font-weight:bold;">[PAUSE X]</span> - tells you to take a pause, I find that 1, 2 and 5 seconds are the most efficient uses. &#8220;1 second&#8221; if I&#8217;m switching from subtopic to subtopic, &#8220;2 seconds&#8221; if I&#8217;m switching to an entirely new topic and &#8220;5 seconds&#8221; if I&#8217;m giving the word to another speaker.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0f0; font-weight:bold;">[LOOK X]</span> - tells you that you should make some eye contact. It&#8217;s quite basic to do it, but sometimes I just forget, so when I see it in my notes, I know what to do. &#8220;X&#8221; can either be left, right or center. You&#8217;ll hardly ever have to look anywhere else.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../../personal-stuff/index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on September 23rd, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Human life, probably like all life on Earth, is tainted by decisions.</p>
<p>There are the important ones like the ones that influence your life, the semi-important ones and the unimportant ones. Naturally, everyone regards various decisions differently. What qualifies as a high priority item for one, is of no importance at all to another.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m facing quite a few important and semi-important issues and some input would be appreciated:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been offered a job from a person I&#8217;ve known for about a year now, while the agreement I signed prohibits me from going into specifics, I can at least tell that it is rather techy. It involves lots of coding, probably some out-sourcing and most certainly lots of learning. The company I&#8217;d be representing has a killer concept and from what I&#8217;ve heard it would most certainly be something I&#8217;d love to do. The question is, am I able to do it.</p>
<p>I know my own skills and I (think I) know what they want. Do I think that I have what it takes? No, not right now anyway. Maybe a few months from now, after I&#8217;ve gained enough knowledge, I&#8217;d be a more suitable candidate. Granted, they, too, know what my skills are and they still asked me, so probably they are more convinced of my skills than I am, which is nice. It&#8217;s still a decision I&#8217;ve got to make though. The salary would be great, but with great money comes great(er) responsibility. The only peeve, so to speak is that it&#8217;s really technical and my goal for the next three years was actually to further develop my artistic skills. Naturally, code (and thus coding too) is poetry and poetry is art, but it&#8217;s not really the kind of art I was thinking about.</p>
<p>As part of my interview with the company, I had to write up a dossier of technologies and solutions I&#8217;d recommend (and sometimes be able to implement) for the concept they&#8217;ve planned out. I think, I did a fairly thorough job, only including the stuff I considered essential and stripping away marketing spiel no one cares about anyway.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how this pans out and if it remains a decision I have to make or if it will be made for me.</p>
<p>Another decision I&#8217;m facing right now is as to what I should further specialize in &#8230; the options I have are audio / video editing or 3D design. If I look at it from a possible income perspective, I&#8217;m quite certain that 3D design is the best choice of the three, however, being the math-tard I am, I might have to struggle too long with the tools needed to get the job done.</p>
<p>A/V editing on the other hand is something I&#8217;ve been interested for quite some time. I started a machinima movie in the summer which I&#8217;m editing, cutting, producing and it&#8217;s fun to work with the tools. You get instant results, it&#8217;s straight forward and interesting. It also links up nicely with the stuff I&#8217;ve been doing for <a href="http://www.scottsigler.net/">Scott</a> so far.</p>
<p>As should be obvious from the two last paragraphs, I&#8217;m kinda partial to A/V editing, not only because it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve already done, but also because it&#8217;s something which I can translate into marketable skills in the near future. Yes, I&#8217;m like that - on the other hand, it&#8217;s also something I&#8217;d love to do in the future. Not full-time, but certainly every now and then, even if it&#8217;s just for homevideos that leave the viewers gaping&#8230;</p>

		<h2 id="post-26"><a href="../../../../../2006/09/21/cmd-feest-aka-cmd-introductory-party-for-freshmen/index.html" rel="bookmark">CMD - feest (aka CMD introductory party for freshmen)</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on September 21st, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>A few hours ago I returned from my first CMD (my college) party - basically a themed party made by and for students from my faculty. &#8220;themed&#8221; is really the keyword here - the topic of yesterday&#8217;s party was &#8220;the Eighties&#8221; and I kinda managed to miss that little fact completely.</p>
<p>Still, the party was awesome, even though I only spotted like three or four freshmen, which is odd, considering that this, first, party was organized especially for freshmen, to make it easier for them to get in touch with sophomores, middlers, juniors and seniors and probably even alumni.</p>
<p>The producers planned out a karaoke event which was fun to listen to and I&#8217;d even taken part, but somehow no one I talked to had the guts to get up on stage and embarrass themselves in front of an audience that was just shy of 120 people. Too bad, maybe better luck next time?</p>
<p>Kudos go out to <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/feest_0906/_MG_371.jpg.html">Geoffrey</a> who hooked me up with a place to crash (which we both did, quite literally) after the party.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;re still reading and want to get a better impression of the whole party, head over to my <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/">gallery</a> and check out the <a href="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/v/college/feest_0906/">party album</a></p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a> on August 28th, 2006 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>As a student, I find that I have little time and loads of work to do, so I like to streamline my workflow. Part of that streamlining process is my hub to the digital world - my Tablet PC, a pimped out Toshiba Tecra M4 running the latest Windows Vista build.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in the formfactor of Tablet PCs and I expect them to be the standard amongst students in about 5 years - well, I hope so anyway and if prices go down, that might just happen.</p>
<p>Financial issues aside, I know that I&#8217;ve had a better learning experience last year because of my Tablet PC. Thanks to applications like Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/programs/onenote/highlights.mspx">OneNote 2007</a> (currently in beta testing), I&#8217;m able to take notes during classes. I don&#8217;t have to worry about bringing the right set of pens or markers with me, OneNote 2007 (and 2003 too, naturally) has it all. Other great features include the ability to transform ink into text (which tends to work even with my chicken scribble) or enhance an image to make the text inside that image (!) searchable. And if you&#8217;re too lazy to write yourself, just take audio notes and listen to the session at your earliest convenience. Feel like sharing your notes? Just export to a PDF and share it with any Windows or Mac user.</p>
<p>Apart from OneNote 2007, I also strongly depend on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/programs/outlook/highlights.mspx">Outlook 2007</a>, which basically handles my day. Once it&#8217;s sync&#8217;ed with my Smartphone, I can always see which class is coming up next and where I ought to be. Doesn&#8217;t get much easier than that.</p>
<p>No matter what you study nowadays, chances are that you&#8217;re gonna use the internet. A good browsing experience is key and as such, I prefer to use Firefox. I don&#8217;t dislike Internet Explorer or anything, I&#8217;m just a lot more satisfied with the features Firefox offers me.</p>
<p>Studying is no fun if you can&#8217;t socialize and since everyone prefers to use a different network (be it MSN, ICQ, Y!, AOL or Skype), I went with <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a> a few years ago and haven&#8217;t looked back once. Trillian is truly the hub of my online life, showing me the information I need (Wikipedia integration, information about Timezones for people from abroad) and enabling me to chat without being annoyed by ads about dating sites or car insurance policies.</p>
<p>Apart from those four, there&#8217;s also Adode Dreamweaver, Fireworks and Flash, as well as Photoshop and Illustrator. Couldn&#8217;t live without any of those really, but the first four, I believe should be installed on any student PC - that is, if you&#8217;re serious about getting good grades.</p>
