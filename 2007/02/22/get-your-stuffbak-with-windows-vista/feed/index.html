		<description>The downside with TrackItBack, for many people, will be that they don't service all of Europe (yet).

Once they do, I'm sure more people will join their service and if they ever add the Netherlands, I'd be more than happy to evaluate their service myself.

For now, though, it's StuffBak for me.</description>

		<description>What you are saying is a good idea, I like it. That said, I'd recommend using Trackitback (www.trackitback.com). They offer free returns and that in itself is good for me. Also, their customer service has been excellent (to date).</description>

		<description>Jan,

so far I've only used StuffBak and Inspice labels / tags, the only software I tried was on a Symbian based smartphone and it never came down to a situation where I'd actually have to use it.

With laptops I'd suggest going for software that is embedded in the BIOS, because otherwise a thief could just swap harddisks and they'd have a functional system (provided, they can bypass the BIOS password too).

The reason why I choose StuffBak over other companies was mainly their design and durability. Labels I've attached nearly two years ago still look as clean as on day one, even though the devices they are attached to have taken a beating.

The colors make StuffBak labels stand out. Their website is easy to use and it just works.

I think, in the end, it all comes down to a personal preference though.</description>
