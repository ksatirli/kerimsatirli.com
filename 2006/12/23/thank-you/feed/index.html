		<description>Hi Kay,
I feel honored to be mentioned in your 'thank you'-list. Like you said yourself we know each other just for a short period. 10 weeks ago with only one thing in common (both a ICT related education) we had to work together to recruit new students for Avans Hogeschool. That was a blast!

Sometimes it’s just scary how we think alike. So I also would like to thank YOU for being such a good friend. Giving me advice whenever I need, pushing me to meet some girls if I couldn't gather enough courage. I don’t know if I have had this pulled this off without you.

Thanks!
