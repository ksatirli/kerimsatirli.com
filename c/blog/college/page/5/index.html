		<p>So, it&#8217;s been more than two months since I last blogged here. The main reason for my absence has been <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">College</a>. We had some new stuff come up that demanded my attention and I kinda got lost in the fun that is game development with Flash Action Script.</p>
<p>The other reason was my recent server move. I&#8217;ve switched the hardware platform (still with the same provider though) and the backups that my control panel generated killed something in the database. No data was lost but some things stopped working and an upgrade to the latest WordPress version didn&#8217;t help. This issue has been fixed though and comments and posting should work fine again.</p>
<p>The final &#8220;excuse&#8221; for not blogging has been the massive amount I spent with customizing <a href="http://instiki.org/">Instiki</a> to better suit my needs. More on that later though.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>Ever so often, a group of teachers at my <a href="http://www.cmd-breda.nl/">college</a> organize a day-long<br />
event that&#8217;s supposed to be all about gaining theoretical knowledge. Few people are looking forward to these days and quite a few students actually &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of even attending the sessions.</p>
<p>A week ago, we had another one of these events, this one, geared towards <em>Serious Gaming</em> and all the things related to creating serious games.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest about this, up front, I didn&#8217;t feel like the event would provide much interesting stuff, if any at all. We had one of these &#8220;Theory Events&#8221; back in the first quarter of this year and the general consensus was that it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>People didn&#8217;t dislike the event based on the idea of the event, but rather on the actual execution of the event. When I attend a class, hearing, discussion panel or anything, I am there for a reason, I want to expand my knowledge. Other than talking about a few Dutch Blogs and trying to explain the concept of Dot Walking to a couple hundred students, the speaker didn&#8217;t do much at all.</p>
<p>Most of us had never heard of Dot Walking and normally, this would have been enough to spark an interesting discussion, however, the whole idea didn&#8217;t offer <em>anything</em> related to our project at all. For my part, a flash mob would have carried more educational value but alas.</p>
<p>So, with the bad taste from the first even still clinging to the back of my mouth, I went to attend the second Theory Event of my sophomore year:</p>
<p>The day was split into three (or four) parts. First, we&#8217;d get to hear a keynote from Annet Dekker, who works at <a href="http://www.montevideo.nl/">Montevideo</a>, an organization that specializes in creating <em>time based arts</em>.</p>
<p>The whole speech was more or less a showcase of her own work, mixed with work that her company created. Ever so often, a short video clip would be used to make it easier for us to visualize her creations. While she did offer some valid points, I found it a tad annoying that she limited her presentation by only selecting stuff she created.</p>
<p>It is natural for people to be proud of what they achieved, however, if your whole keynote only relates to your own products, you&#8217;re lacking perspective and that makes you appear a lot more biased than you probably are.</p>
<p>After a short break, we were treated to a movie called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXistenZ">eXistenZ</a>. Released in the same year as <em>The Matrix</em>, the movie tells a similar but not identical story.</p>
<p>In both movies, people use <em>ports</em> in their bodies to link themselves to a system that operates solely on a metaphysical level, but that&#8217;s where the similarities end.</p>
<p>eXistenZ is about a game, a game that is so real that players can&#8217;t tell if they are still playing it or not. Playing might actually not be the right word in this case, it&#8217;s more of an experience than pure entertainment.</p>
<p>The participants don&#8217;t just passively enjoy the offerings of the system, they actually are part of the (mostly linear) story.</p>
<p>The movie was great and I certainly enjoyed watching it, mostly because the ideas portrayed within the movie become less and less of a probability and more and more of a reality.</p>
<p>The ideas also kinda remind me of &#8220;<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=nA4TKAJKTwk">Counter-Struck</a>&#8220;, a parody of the well known game Counter-Strike. The director of the movie, a fellow crossmedia engineering student, tells the story of a player who immerses himself that much in the game, that the game starts <em>happening</em> around the player.</p>
<p>After another short break, Daniël van Gils, chief-creative-guy at <a href="http://www.kamerblauwlicht.nl/">KamerBlauwLicht</a> showcased a few great Machinima movies (some even unknown to me) and tried to riddle us with the following questions:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Is gaming art?</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>can games be used to create art</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>This was probably the most memorable part of the whole day, most certainly because I&#8217;m working on my own movie and have a strong opinion about this:</p>
<p>Van Gils appears to be a strong supporter of Machinima and he seems to be fascinated by it. He went as far as creating a mod for the Doom III engine that would allow him to create a live performance that was inspired by the music playing around him.</p>
<p>This really shows how committed this person really is towards Machinima and I have to applaud him for embracing such a new form of art in such an extensive way. Especially since most people don&#8217;t even know what Machinima really is and what it can be used for.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of years ago, cave paintings were the first form of art that humans created. Today, if you&#8217;re able to acquire a piece with a real cave painting on it, you probably would be holding not only a piece of history, but also a piece of significant monetary value in your hands.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is that, over the millenia, art has evolved. From the cave paintings to the Mona Lisa, from the first sketches of Aristoteles to the Wrapped Reichstag, art has been evolving and <em>still</em> is.</p>
<p>A few decades ago, graffitti wasn&#8217;t considered art, but today it is. Sure, it hasn&#8217;t yet reached the same level of acceptance oil paintings have, but that is mostly because oil paintings have been around much longer.</p>
<p>A few years from now, Machinima will have gained a much larger following. In recent months, the barrier for entering this genre has been lowered quite a bit. Editing tools, for both video and audio, have become a lot more accessible and many different kinds are available, catering to novice users as well as professionals alike.</p>
<p>More and more companies are embracing Machinima as valid forms of marketing. Not just because it offers a low-cost alternative to expensive CG graphics, but also because it has more of an amateuristic factor to it, something that can often work in favor of the director.</p>
<p>All in all, this event was a lot more interesting than the first one and provided me with the questions I was looking for. The sessions made me think, made me discuss and made me talk about the ideas that were presented to us and that&#8217;s all I want.</p>

	<div class="main">
		<p>People are being influenced by their surroundings. In order to not alienate yourself from the people that you love, you&#8217;ll most probably try to fit in. Sure, some try harder than others, but all do try. That is my opinion anyway.</p>
<p>Most of the times, the better you fit in in your surroundings, the more success you will achieve, sometimes though, your environment can be damaging to you, your health or your future.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this yesterday and started analyzing the comments I received from various people in my life, people who know me or like to think that they know me. Some of them, in my opinion, are more qualified than others to &#8220;judge&#8221; me, some are entirely unfit to comment on anything.</p>
<p>About a year ago, someone I was spending a lot of time with at the time, claimed that I&#8217;m way too childish for my age. She deemed my behavior inappropriate and basically recommended me to &#8220;grow up a little&#8221;.</p>
<p>Naturally, after being with someone for three years, those claims aren&#8217;t just thoughts that were spat out in a heated discussion, but are something that managed to manifest itself over time.</p>
<p>Then, a few months later, when college began again, I had my second meeting with the mentor that was assigned to me. Her thoughts about me collided totally with what I&#8217;ve been told earlier. She thought of me as &#8220;way too business-focussed&#8221;, bordering the &#8220;uptight&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny when you think about it. A person you&#8217;ve known for about three hours at the time (that is, two meetings of 90 minutes each) thinks she is qualified to judge you and your actions.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that her opinion should be dismissed, after all, she may or may not have studied psychology and thus may very well be capable of evaluating a student&#8217;s actions and provide feedback based upon that.</p>
<p>On the other hand though, you have to understand where people are coming from. The first person had a personal interest in the issue. She would benefit if I&#8217;d change. The second person, according to my opinion, just tried to force her views on me. She wouldn&#8217;t gain anything if I&#8217;d become less &#8220;uptight&#8221;, other than personal gratification.</p>
<p>The other day, I was talking to two other people. The first one, a person I&#8217;ve been working with for 18 months now, called me a &#8220;friggin&#8217; rockstar&#8221; and outlined how he deemed my mindset totally appropriate for the things I am trying to achieve.</p>
<p>He also shared some personal experience with me about how people in his (professional) environment told him to slow down, be less uptight and relax more. In his opinion, those that lack focus will always try to slow you down, not for your own best will, but because they perceive you as a threat. According to him, if you would slow down, it would give those people a chance to catch up with you, on a professional level and you&#8217;d be less competitive.</p>
<p>The way I see it, I have to strongly agree with his assessment. I know that I&#8217;m focussed and can be too focussed in times when said focus is needed. That however, doesn&#8217;t mean that I lack perspective. Most of all the actions I have taken in the last years are geared towards one objective: finishing college and gaining a skill set that will make me competitive on the market I am going to work on.</p>
<p>I see students in my college who are, technically speaking, able to achieve a lot, maybe more than me, but they don&#8217;t try to. Some of them just don&#8217;t care about being successful, some of them just lack the needed focus.</p>
<p>In essence, it comes down to the following: If people in your environment tell you to slow down, take where they are coming from into consideration. Don&#8217;t just do it because you value them, think about yourself first.</p>
<p>They may be able to distort your perception, but as long as you enable yourself to put some perspective to it, you should be able to distinguish those that are telling you to slow down so they can gain an advantage on you and those who are genuinely worried about you and your workload.</p>

		<h2 id="post-73"><a href="../../../../../2007/03/02/next-night-20/index.html" rel="bookmark">Next Night 2.0</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../media/events/index.html" title="View all posts in Events" rel="category tag">Events</a> on March 2nd, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>This past Tuesday, <a href="http://www.generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a> organized the second evening in their, so far, successful, series of events called &#8220;Next Night&#8221;. The idea behind these events is to bring (CMD) students in touch with market influencer as well as innovation leaders and academic researchers, thereby creating an intriguing evening loaded with useful information. The best thing is that it&#8217;s limited to a small group of people and so far, I&#8217;ve only seen people who <strong>really</strong> wanted to be there.</p>
<p>The evening was kicked off by Barend Raaff from <a href="http://www.dnbmedia.com/">DNB Media</a>. The speech contained some interesting questions - for example in regards of the latest events that are happening in Second Life and who should be held accountable for them:</p>
<p>Mr. Raaff likes to think of Second Life as a means of communication, not unlike the phone system operated by KPN or Ma Bell. He goes on to explain that the medium cannot be blamed for the things some, misguided users do with it.</p>
<p>This week, two nuclear missiles were <a href="http://www.dutchcowboys.nl/online/9572/">exploded</a> in Second Life. The objective behind this mission that was spearheaded by the Second Life Liberation Army (SLLA) is to make Linden Labs, the developers of the game, aware to the fact that users want to more control over the Sims (the gaming environments) and that they won&#8217;t refrain from taking game altering actions.</p>
<p>The type of bomb that was used can be acquired in-game and their effect is nearly as devastating as in real life. The explosions consume so much CPU power that the servers just shut down. With 2700 Second Life servers out there, one would think that two servers wouldn&#8217;t matter, but unfortunately they do. Every time, someone sets off a bomb and kills a server, there is a 25% chance that the server that crashes will take another server with it. This percentage increases by one point with every server that gets killed successfully.</p>
<p>The shutdown also means that any data that wasn&#8217;t saved might be lost, which could incur real-world economical ramifications, because, after all, the Second Life currency known as Linden Dollars has to be acquired by real world money. On that topic, Mr. Raaff also noted that he doesn&#8217;t (yet) consider Linden Dollars to be a threat to actual real-world currency.</p>
<p>The second speaker was Bas van Ulden, head of the Second Life team of <a href="http://www.abnamro.nl/">ABN AMRO</a>, a well known financial institution. His team managed to create an online presence inside Second Life, thereby earning his team the title of &#8220;First European bank in Second Life&#8221;. Quite a feat, especially if you consider that most of the team didn&#8217;t use Second Life before and they managed to build the whole thing in a mere eight weeks.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that ABN AMRO bought 32 sims, however, only six or seven are currently in use and by summer 2007, another ten sims will be made accessible to the general public. I&#8217;m curious as to what they have in store for their customers.</p>
<p>I think their approach, so far, is unique. They are the first European bank I know off that let&#8217;s you &#8220;skype&#8221; with your account manager (as opposed to calling an expensive phone number) as well as check your account balance via <a href="../../../../../tech-talk/guides/geeky-tools-you-will-want-to-use/index.html">MSN Messenger</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, the decision to start out in Second Life was entirely business based, after all, the Netherlands are home to the biggest non-English community on Second Life.  However, you can tell that this bank really values the social aspect of the Internet and Mr. Ulden&#8217;s speech was probably the best of the whole evening. Not because it offered possible employment opportunities to anyone interested and qualified, but rather because he was very open about the whole experience. He didn&#8217;t refrain from telling us how much they did wrong and how they had to learn the hard way.</p>
<p>I value his honesty and I think it tells a lot about how he and his small team of ten thinks of the net community.</p>
<p>The keynote was concluded by some statistics which gave some insight into the success of the whole operation. It turned out that ABN AMRO gets about 500 to 600 visitors a week in all their Sims combined and even though they only cater to the Dutch market right now, they get the occasional foreign visitor too.</p>
<p>After a short break, Raymond van der Kaaij from <a href="http://www.lostinthemagicforest.com/">(lost in the) Magic Forest</a> kicked off the second half of the evening by sharing some insight into the hows and whats of marketing in Second Life. For example, if you want to expand your base of operations into Second Life, you should ask yourself how you can do that in a way that links up with your offline brand. It is important to know how you can add value to the experience of the visitor and how you can turn them into recurring visitors.</p>
<p>Mr. van der Kaaij also believes the &#8220;whole thing&#8221; to be about experience design: &#8220;If there&#8217;s no experience then there&#8217;s no unique selling point and that&#8217;s when you should stop considering Second Life as a base of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>David de Nood from <a href="http://www.epn.net/">EPN</a> concluded the evening by explaining how Second Life was a game without a set ending point, but far from pointless. He also shared some very interesting stats with us. It turns out that from the group of heavy users, that is, people that play approximately ten to forty hours a week, more than half is female. What&#8217;s even more interesting is that this group is between 25 and 40 years old and has at least completed college. Most of them have creative jobs in the IT or marketing sector.</p>
<p>Even though this group plays an average of 25 hours a week, only 40% of the members consider themselves addicted to the game. The main reason, according to Mr. de Nood is, that the psycho-social wellbeing in-game, is a lot higher than outside, in the real world. It&#8217;s easier to establish contacts because there&#8217;s some sense of anonymity. EPN&#8217;s research also predicts that more businesses (especially those with goods related to Second Life) will open up to payments made in Linden Dollars.</p>
<p>The evening was concluded with an informal discussion where all of the speakers actively took part in. Thanks a lot to Marc and Noortje and the other members from <a href="http://www.generation-next.nl/">Generation Next</a> for setting up this meeting. Congratulations on a job well done. I&#8217;m already looking forward to see what you guys can come up with for Next Night 3.0!</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in College" rel="category tag">College</a>, <a href="../../../../personal-stuff/index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on February 16th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>Today&#8217;s economy is all about money, it has been like that for years and it will probably be like that for the remainder of time, unless someone comes up with an ingenious solution that replaces money with another object of value that is easy to exchange, both in the real world as well as digitally. Since I don&#8217;t see that happening any time soon, I might as well discuss an idea I had about teaching our young ones how to &#8220;work&#8221; with money.</p>
<p>Before we start, let&#8217;s take a minute to think back. I think I got my first money to spend at the age of seven, but I had been spending other people&#8217;s money (namely from my parents) before that. I would be rewarded for school activity as well as the occasional monetary present for birthdays. While this worked out nicely for me back then, I think the system is flawed. Later on, when you&#8217;re a grown-up, nobody will give you money just because you turn a year older. Well, some people might do, but those are the ones with bad taste, and it&#8217;s never going to be enough to sustain yourself. Basically, I think that parents are teaching their children nothing about the value of money by &#8220;just&#8221; giving them access to funds.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m proposing, basically, is the following: give children money, based on the work they carry out. Chores should of course be appropriate to their age, you can&#8217;t expect a five year-old to go shopping, you might end up with no money at all and a bill for the dentist. Have kids work around the house. Most children aren&#8217;t interested in that kind of stuff at those ages, so why not utilize a system that works so well, even primates pick up on it?</p>
<p>The &#8220;do this, get that&#8221; method is, if you ask me, a lot better than just giving kids an allowance that you replenish whenever the kids need it. Working for money is an essential factor of life, so why not start out as early as possible? Protecting your children from the harshness that is the world? Well, good luck with that. What good does that do? Ten years later, you have children who are completely incapable of managing the funds they have access to and you&#8217;ll end up having to teach them the whole system after all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read about people who taught their children the value of money in creative ways. Mom would tell her son to look through grocery fliers and the more coupons and great deals he could get, the more they would save. The saved money then, would be his reward. Does that teach children the value of money? You bet it does. The more you save, the more you get to keep. It&#8217;s as easy as that.</p>
<p>Now, in todays digital world, you could enhance the whole process a lot. Create a game I say. One that is a win-win solution for everyone involved, parents, children and the economy. If you&#8217;re going to create it, however, you should do it the right way. A famous Dutch financial institution tried and in my eyes, fail to meet the goal I&#8217;m trying for.</p>
<p>Said bank came up with a system that let&#8217;s you save money. You have a piece of hardware, connected to your computer. Put in a dime and you&#8217;ll see the computer process it in a visual way. You can always see how much you have, but you can&#8217;t really use it. It works great to teach people about saving money, but, in the end, why do we save money? Exactly, to spend it, when the time comes.</p>
<p>Their system lets children play games that are branded with the companies logos and everything. Every game costs a certain amount of points. You have x points every day and a game costs, say 1/10 of x. So you can play ten games a day. Very nice, if you want to keep your kid from turning into a gambler, but it doesn&#8217;t teach them anything about the real value. Like before, the problem is that the points are restored daily. In fact, parents can even buy more points for you, if need be.</p>
<p>My idea is different. Let&#8217;s create a game that combines online and offline chores. It&#8217;s gotta be entertaining to the kids, or they won&#8217;t play it, but it&#8217;s also gotta be educative. I propose to utilize the &#8220;do this, get that&#8221; method.</p>
<p>The application itself, would be aimed at an audience between three and six, so it would be heavy on the visual side and only include easy to read (and understand) text for the player. The application is basically a shell, your access to a myriad of minigames, some of which could be branded by the companies that support this game (and I&#8217;m certain, there would be quite a few).</p>
<p>Each minigame has to be entertaining. You&#8217;d have simple games, for example, stuff where you match pairs but also more advanced stuff, for example, reading easy words and linking them to their visual counterparts. After completing a level, the &#8220;boss&#8221; of that level is a real-world chore, related to the game. If you matched pairs ingame, why not go help your mom match socks? Sounds easy, but it would help both parents and children. The idea is that the kids first play something, then complete a chore, related to the game and finally get their reward. Both points in game as well as a monetary reward.</p>
<p>The game contains sophisticated tracking systems so that you can see how long your kid takes for a certain part, but I&#8217;d advise to spend the time on the computer <em>with</em> your kid, after all, there&#8217;s no better guardian than the one that&#8217;s there, when they need it. The tracking system also will show you statistics, like what does your child like to do most? What does it <em>not</em> like? You can then adjust the rewards in a way that for example, cleaning up the room, something just about every child hates, becomes a lot more interesting, financially speaking.</p>
<p>Heck, we could even digitize the aforementioned idea about having your kid look through grocery folders. Said minigame would have to be sponsored by a grocery store of course and the coupons would be for their products only. The player would be presented with a selection of say hundred coupons and then mark the ones that are of interest to him or her. Once the &#8220;level&#8221; is finished, call your parents, have them check the list, print it out and if they approve, enter a special parent-code™ that would translate into the reward.</p>
<p>Said parent-codes™ are printed lists with an unique identifier. There&#8217;s a pair of two codes each. One you have to enter before you start a game, one you have to enter after the player has completed a level. The game doesn&#8217;t handle situations where you start a game, then start another though because players are expected to only commit to something if they are willing to pull through. Much like in real life, later on.</p>
<p>All in all, this game has the potential to do three things: help children understand the value of money, help parents with their workload and help the economy create people who understand the value of money and brand children with brands they will be buying later on.</p>
