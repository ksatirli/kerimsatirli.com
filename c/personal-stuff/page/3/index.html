		<p>The last few days have been so hectic, with meet-ups here and meet-ups there that I totally forgot to post this, but finally, here it is:</p>
<p>2007 would not have been 2007 if it were not for the three meetups I had during the last days; first Emma, then Claske and finally - the one meeting I have been looking forward to since we first met virtually: <a href="http://www.jeroenpoortvliet.nl/">Jeroen Poortvliet</a>.</p>
<p>Jeroen and me have been working on both building and maintaining a special interest community for no less than 30 months now and after much planning and shifting, we finally managed to get together for a pint of beer.</p>
<p>Jeroen, who is a real-life photographer has been spearheading the expansion of our community and it is safe to say that, without him, NL-Noob would not be what we have become. Thanks to his efforts, our turnover rate is incredibly low compared to other communities and what&#8217;s even better - whenever we seemed to hit a snag or stagnation in growth, he came up with ideas that allowed us to expand even further.</p>
<p>We are, by no means the biggest (Dutch) community, but we have a fair number of people that are <em>very</em> happy that we are there, when they need a gaming fix.</p>
<p>Marjon on the other hand, is totally uninvolved in gaming, but still made a tremendous impact on me, most of all because of the inner strength she possesses and if there is something I respect in people a lot, then it is the ability to conquer literally anything they are faced with. No <a href="../../../../blog/personal/micro-relationships/index.html">micro-relationship</a> here, just great talks and mutual trust.</p>
<p>And last but not least, the <em>Wingman of the year award</em> goes out to <a href="http://www.kevinpilasky.nl/">Kevin</a> for accompanying me to a number of great and interesting events and helping me with most, if not all, <a href="http://www.nachotalk.com/">visual branding</a> things that <a href="http://www.xdaflameusers.com/">came up</a> over the <a href="http://www.cuizine.tv/">past year</a>.</p>
<p>I could probably go on for a fair bit, because the above mentioned people are <em>by no means</em> the only ones that made an impression on me, but I wont. The ones I care about know that I do and that&#8217;s that.</p>

		<p>&#8230; to all of those that congratulated me today. I have received comments via email, text messages, a very funny voice message and even a handshake from a train conductor - how about that?</p>
<p>The two items that stood out the most though, were the ones I did not expect at all:</p>
<p>Dorien Aerts, whom I met at the <a href="../../../../blog/media/events/european-bloggers-conference-thursday-recap/index.html">European Bloggers Conference</a> last Thursday sent me this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21943-1/birthday_2.png" alt="Facebook: Dorien Aerts B'day message" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Olga Gachko, from <a href="http://spbsoftwarehouse.com/">Spb</a>, maker of fine Windows Mobile Software sent me:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://gallery.kerimsatirli.com/d/21940-1/birthday_1.png" alt="Facebook: Spb B'day message" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spb&#8217;s message was totally unexpected, yet a very kind gesture. It shows that the company is committed to keeping their customers ( = brand multipliers) happy and that is what counts in business.</p>
<p>To all the others that did not make the blog - thank you all, too!</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on September 20th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>I was just reading up some of the questions my LinkedIn contacts were asking and came across a rather interesting one, asked by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers/career-education/mentoring/CAR_MEN/100684-2646566?trk=mh_viewq_1">F.Xavier Garcia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Who wants to share a dream ?</strong></p>
<p>I am a &#8220;Professional Dreamer&#8221; which means I like to listen to people&#8217;s dreams, see how many are in common with mine and how we can manifest them faster. All my dreams are bold and ambitious, my main dream is to leave the planet in a better state than it was on the day I was born.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wether or not F. Xavier really gets this done is not the point here, what is important is that he still dares to dream, in a world that is so full of corporate drones that sometimes one feels like an outcast as a dreamer&#8230;</p>
<p>One person offered an answer that more than underlines my above statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dreams are like rainbows. Only idiots chase them.</p></blockquote>
<p>And even though the statement was most probably meant to contain a humorous undertone, it seems to be the sad truth. Too many of us have lost track of their (original) dream. People, especially males, get sidetracked easily. A new business opportunity presents itself, a new hobby and suddenly, the original dream is not important anymore.</p>
<p>In closing, I think the way Kent Dryer put it is spot on:</p>
<blockquote><p>What about making an impact on others? Too many of us are selfish and are so wrapped up that we have a hard time making a difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dare to pursue your dreams, it will make you a happy ( / happier) person.</p>

	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on August 29th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>It is said that one should treat his friends well, for they are worth much more than any wealth or property in the world.</p>
<p>There is a lot of truth to be found in the proverbs of the Bourgeoisie, because these figures of speech are tried and time-tested and thus still hold true in this very day and age.</p>
<p>If I were the dramatic kind of person, I would say that today marks the first day of a different life for me. The reason for that is that I stood up a friend and person I respect a lot, a person I look up to and a person I have had the privilege of sharing a great amount of things with together.</p>
<p>I pride myself in being the loyal kind of friend, the person that you can rely on when things start hitting the fan at light speed. I normally am the person that will stand by you, even if others abandoned you long ago and yet, here I am, looking back at three weeks of utter stupidity, immature behavior and very <em>un-me-ish</em> actions.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, it is hard to find the rare ones, the ones that are willing to teach you, tutor you and show you the stuff that you would normally have to pay for, fight for and beg for.</p>
<p>I have managed to find one of these rare ones and I treasured it for a long time now, in fact, I still do but at the end of the day, not everything is mutual.</p>
<p>It is said that one should treat his friends well, for they are worth much more than any wealth or property in the world.</p>
<p>It is also said that, given time and space, friendships can overcome hardships and problems and issues can be solved, made to disappear and cease to exist and to be honest, there is nothing in this world that I would like to do more.</p>
<p>I have grown attached to you, to you as a person, to you as a friend, to you as a tutor and to to you as a contact. You made me cheer when I felt bad and you provided perspective when I needed it. You, my friend, made me do a great amount of things I would not have done, or even considered, without your gentle prod.</p>
<p>In return, you received zilch, nothing, nada. Just an unthankful, short-sighted and incredibly stupid person.</p>
<p>This is not how friendships work and I realize that. I also realize that saying &#8220;I learned my lesson&#8221; does not cut it here, in fact, it does not cut it all - it does not even scratch it.</p>
<p>My actions were crazy, disrespectful and plain shitty, period. I hope that, at some point, we can reestablish our friendship and that you will be able to trust me again. I would like that, I would like that very much.</p>
<p><small>For those that were expecting juicy bits in this letter, I apologize. I feel that there is no need to involve my contacts, simply because this is not about their name(s), but about honesty and remorse.</small></p>

		<h2 id="post-112"><a href="../../../../2007/08/06/exhaustion-in-the-modern-world/index.html" rel="bookmark">Exhaustion in the modern World</a></h2>	
	<div class="meta">posted in <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in personal stuff" rel="category tag">personal stuff</a> on August 6th, 2007 </div>
	<div class="main">
		<p>According to an old proverb, <em>Haste makes waste</em>. Applied to the modern World, this would mean that, the more stressed out you are, the more susceptible to a host of bad things you will be..</p>
<p>Grab a <a href="http://www.nrc.nl/next/">newspaper</a> or read <a href="http://evelien-online.blogspot.com/2007/07/out.html">a blog</a> and you will come across at least one person that is having to cope with the results of an insanely busy life. Students, according to recent studies generally sleep between five to six hours a night, a lot less than the recommended eight hours and of course, voice their opinions about this. Teachers, too, are experiencing increased stress; colleges want more money, which means more students and more tutoring for teachers.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there is the self-inflicted stress. Most of us have been there, the place where you are faced with a decision: <em>deadline</em> or <em>sleep</em> and from my own experience, I know that I always go for <em>deadline</em>. At college, we occasionally joke about this, after all, you can sleep all you want once you are dead&#8230; We also joked about the fact that, approximately six years after we all graduated, at least one third would be suffering from burn out.</p>
<p>Funny as it may sound at first, this is becoming a huge problem. Yes, there are those among us that can easily cope with little to no sleep and still function normally, but there are even more among us that can not cope with even one hour less sleep, much less three to four hours less. Yet, many people of these two groups are subject to the same amount of stress and once it turns sour for them, it often ends in a burn a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29">burn out</a>.</p>
<p>Classified as a psychological condition, burn outs are, in fact, very capable of inflicting harm to a person&#8217;s physique. Studies generally state that EMTs and Air Traffic Controllers are very prone to this condition, because, after all, stress comes with the territory in those jobs, but more and more statistics are facing that suggest that even the most mundane job can lead to a burn out.</p>
<p>How that happens, in many cases, is not totally clear, but I suspect that it has to do with the way we are conditioned to live our lives. No helpful advice from me this time, just something I was discussing with a <a href="http://nsnelson.wordpress.com/">friend</a> some time ago.</p>
<p>An old proverb says that <em>the bow needs to be unsprung once in a while or it loses its spring</em>. What this means is basically that the more stress you subject your body (and mind) to, the more often you will need to give yourself some time to relax. If you do not occasionally &#8220;reset&#8221; yourself, your <em>bow</em> ( = mind) will not serve you as well as it did in the past.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is not only limited to your professional life but also embraces your social life. Sometimes, stress makes you perform better, but too much of it will ruin your abilities and appetite and will make you lose interest in many things you enjoyed before, simply because you are incapable of handling anything because you are too exhausted.</p>
<p>So, keep in mind that you need to blow off some steam every now and then, because all the action you see is worthless if you end up not being able to enjoy it because you are too exhausted to leave your bed for more than a couple of hours at a time.</p>
